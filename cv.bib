To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. In this work, we develop demand driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, d3ploy. User-controlled capabilities such as supply/ capacity buffers, constraint deployment, prediction algorithms, and installed capacity deployment were introduced in d3ploy to give a user the tools to minimize commodity undersupply in a simulation. We demonstrate d3ploy{\textquoteright}s capability to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet various types of user-defined power demands: constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal.},

	abstract = {Nuclear reactor design can improve economics, safety, breeding capability, and operational flexibility.
Accordingly, we introduce an efficient, robust, and reliable design recommendation approach based on
machine learning methods. This approach explores seven independent input parameters in the context of a
single fuel channel of Molten Salt Fast Reactor, including fissile material (U, U/Pu, U/Th), salt type (Na,
Cl, F), enrichment, channel pitch, channel length, moderator-to-salt ratio, and channel power (or channel
outlet temperature). Performance metric for optimization include kinf , the conversion ratio ($\gamma$), feedback
coefficients ($\alpha$D , $\alpha$V , $\alpha$M ), and the fast flux incident on graphite material. Optimization, data mining and
sampling in this work will rely on the RAVEN framework, developed by the Idaho National Laboratory,
to produce the datasets, to explore the parameter space, and to train a model for recommending design
optimization. The tool created in this work couples to the SERPENT neutron transport software to
compute these design performance metrics. We expect this tool will make significant contributions to core
design optimization by exposing multitudinous possible scenarios, facilitating decision making, accelerating
the design process and reducing the man-hours consumed in modeling.},

	abstract = {Current radioisotope identification devices struggle to identify and quantify isotopes in low-resolution gamma-ray spectra in a wide range of realistic conditions. Trained gamma-ray spectroscopists typically rely on intuition when identifying isotopes in spectra. A trained gamma-ray spectroscopist can inject their intuition into pattern recognition algorithms by creating training datasets and intelligently choosing a machine learning model for a task. Algorithms based on feature extraction such as peak finding or ROI algorithms work well for well-calibrated high resolution detectors. For low-resolution detectors, it may be more beneficial to use algorithms that incorporate more abstract features of the spectrum. To investigate this, we simulated datasets and used them to train artificial neural networks (ANNs) for identification and quantification tasks using gamma-ray spectra. Because the datasets were simulated, this method can be extended to a variety of gamma-ray spectroscopy tasks. Models weinvestigated include dense, convolutional, and autoencoder ANNs. In this work we introduce annsa, an open source Python package capable of creating gamma-ray spectroscopy training datasets and applying machine learning models to solve spectroscopic tasks. Using annsa, we found that identification performance in simulated spectra was sensitive to the source-to-background ratio, detector gain setting, and shielding. Performance was less sensitive to the source-detector height and detector resolution. We demonstrate annsa{\textquoteright}s capabilities on a source inter-
diction classification problem, outperforming a peak-based Bayesian classifier for source identification. We also demonstrate annsa on a uranium enrich-
ment quantification problem which shows an accuracy useful for homeland security applications.},

This quick, flexible, medium-fidelity method to estimate depleted PWR fuel assembly compositions is used to model scenarios in which the PWR fuel burnup and enrichment vary over time. The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST\&DARDS) Unified Database (UDB) provided a ground truth on which the model trained. We validated the model by comparing the U.S. UNF inventory profile predicted by the model with the UDB UNF inventory profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error for UNF inventory decay heat and activity and less than 2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model takes 0.27 s for 100 predictions, compared to 118 s for 100 Oak Ridge Isotope GENeration (ORIGEN) calculations. We also implemented this model into Cyclus, an agent-based Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity PWR depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of batches with assemblies of varying burnup. Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model, this trained model can provide open-source depletion capabilities to NFC simulators. We show that training an artificial neural network with a dataset from a complex fuel depletion model can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.},

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic Power (TAP) MSR. A Python toolkit, SaltProc v0.1 [1{\textendash}3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). More recently, an advanced SaltProc version (SaltProc v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the TAP system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards milestone M2.1: Demonstrate SaltProc and the steps toward the subsequent Task 2 objectives.},

	url = {https://books.google.com/books/about/GLOBAL_2017.html?id=1UjsuQEACAAJ},
	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle simulation scenarios are most naturally described as 
constrained objective functions. The objectives are often systemic 
demands such as ``achieve 1\% growth for total electricity production 
and reach 10\% uranium utilization''. The constraints take 
the form of nuclear fuel cycle technology availability 
(``reprocessing begins after 2025 and fast reactors first become 
available in 2050'').

To match the natural constrained objective form of the scenario 
definition, NFC simulators must bring demand responsive 
deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic.

In particular, a NFC simulator should have the 
capability to deploy supporting fuel cycle facilities to enable 
a demand to be met. Take, for instance, the standard once through fuel 
cycle. Reactors may be deployed to meet a objective power demand. 
However, new mines, mills, and enrichment facilities will also need to be 
deployed to ensure that reactors have sufficient fuel to produce power.  
In many simulators, the unrealistic solution to this problem is to 
simply have infinite capacity support facilities. Alternatively, 
detailing the deployment timeline of all facilities becomes the 
responsibility of the user.

The authors seek to identify the most flexible, general, and performant 
algorithms applicable to this modeling challenge.  Accordingly, a review was 
conducted of current NFC simulation tools to determine the 
current capabilites for demand-driven and transition scenarios. 
Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic
innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains
such as economics and industrial engineering.},

These SFRs are fueled with UNF accumulated by other EU nations and reprocessed in France. The impact of reactor lifetime extensions and SFR breeding ratios on time-to-transition were investigated with additional simulations. These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment of additional LWRs by accepting UNF from other EU nations, that lifetime extensions delay time-to-transition, and improved breeding ratios are not particularly impactful.},

- Nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste disposal decisions are technologically coupled through the characteristics of spent fuel which vary among fuel cycles and impact repository design and performance
- Dynamic integration of generic disposal model with fuel cycle systems analysis framework is necessary to illuminate performance distinctions of candidate repository host media, designs, and engineering components in the context of fuel cycle options
- Most current tools treat waste disposal phase of fuel cycle analysis statically in post processing by reporting values such as mass, volumes, radiotoxicity, or heat production of accumulated SNF and high level waste.

	abstract = {Modeling and simulation of neutron kinetics in liquid-fueled nuclear reactors incorporates three major challenging components. First, it is necessary to establish the dynamic evolution of fuel composition via depletion and online reprocessing. Additionally, multiphysics analysis of the thermal hydraulics and neutronics in such a reactor must incorporate thermal feedbacks and material expansion feedbacks. Finally, drift of delayed neutron precursors must be incorporated into the kinetics analysis due to the mobility of the liquid fuel. This talk will discuss all three components. Toward the first component, a discussion of the SaltProc python package will establish the fuel composition dynamics capabilities necessary for fuel composition depletion in the context of online reprocessing. Toward the second component, a point kinetics model implementation in PyRK, and a more sophisticated advection model implementation in Moltres will be discussed. Finally, incorporation in Moltres of neutron diffusion and precursor equations will be discussed as will their implementation using the MOOSE action system.},

	abstract = {In the search for new ways to generate carbon-free, reliable base-load power, interest in advanced nuclear energy technologies, particularly Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), has resurged with multiple new companies pursuing MSR commercialization. To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

Current work introduces an extension of the MOOSE framework, Moltres, to appropriately model coupled thermal-hydraulics and neutronics of promising liquid-fueled Molten Salt Reactor designs.

Initial simulations of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) have been conducted on Blue Waters supercomputer with deterministic multiphysics. Steady state, transient, and fuel cycle analysis simulations have been run in 2D as well as 3D and compared against the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. These simulations have occupied up to many hundreds of nodes simultaneously and have resulted in rich datasets for use in reactor design and analysis. This talk will describe how coupling between neutronics and thermal hydraulics have been established in the Moltres as well as the validation and verification efforts which have been completed.},

JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a digital object identifier (DOI), deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review.

	abstract = {The four Generic Disposal System Models (GDSMs) developed by the Used Fuel Disposition Campaign (UFD) campaign facilitate sensitivity analysis of the long-term post-closure performance of geologic repositories in generic media with respect to various key processes and parameters [1]. Processes and parameters expected to be influential to repository performance include the rate of waste form degradation, timing of waste package failure, and various coupled geochemical and hydrologic characteristics of the natural system including diffusion, solubility, and advection.
The results here provide an overview of the relative importance of processes and parameters that affect the long term performance attributes of clay generic disposal environments. This work is not intended to give an assessment of the performance of a specific disposal system. Rather, it is intended to generically identify properties and parameters expected to influence repository performance in generic clay geologic environments.},

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle is an established field with multiple players. Prior development work has utilized tech- niques such as system dynamics to provide a solution structure for the matching of supply and demand in these simulations. In general, however, simulation infrastructure development has occured in relatively closed circles, each effort having unique considerations as to the cases which are desired to be modeled. Accordingly, individual simulators tend to have their design decisions driven by specific use cases. Presented in this work is a proposed supply and demand matching algorithm that lever- ages the techniques of the well-studied field of mathematical programming. A generic approach is achieved by treating fa- cilities as individual entities and actors in the supply-demand market which denote preferences amongst commodities. Using such a framework allows for varying levels of interaction fi- delity, ranging from low-fidelity, quick solutions to high-fidelity solutions that model individual transactions (e.g. at the fuel- assembly level). The power of the technique is that it allows such flexibility while still treating the problem in a generic man- ner, encapsulating simulation engine design decisions in such a way that future simulation requirements can be relatively easily added when needed.},

The GENIUSv2 tool proposes to inform nuclear fuel cycle technology and policy by providing a richly detailed, modular platform capable of dynamically modeling complexly integrated international fuel cycles such as those involving separations and reprocessing schemes.
Here we present results of the GENIUSv2 testing suite which demonstrate neutronics weighting methods for approximating optimal mixed oxide fuel compositions. These weighting methods achieve various levels of success at assembling critical fuel recipes from separated spent fuel streams for fuel cycles incorporating mixed oxide reprocessing. Results of neutronics constraining and neutronics weighting methods are here compared and alternative linear programmatic formulations are proposed for determining mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel compositions from available material.},

	abstract = {The theory of non-ideal gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, for instance the van der Waals gas model, has played a central role in the understanding of coexisting phases. Here, we report a combined experimental, numerical and theoretical study of a liquid-solid-like phase transition which takes place in a vertically vibrated fluidized granular monolayer. The first experimental setup is a long, narrow channel, with a width of the order of a few particle diameters, hence the dynamics is quasi-one-dimensional. We have considered this configuration to characterize the dynamic behavior of the phase transition. The second setup is used to measure the pressure as function of particle density in order to clarify the physical mechanism behind this phase transition. We demonstrate that the transition is mediated by waves and that it is triggered by a negative compressibility as in van der Waals phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. Finally, in order to further characterize this phase transition, we study static and dynamic correlation functions, and bond-orientational order parameters.},

terial among discrete facilities, arranged in a geographic and
institutional framework, and trading in flexible markets. Key
concepts in the design of C YCLUS include open access to the
simulation engine, modularity with regard to functionality, and
relevance to both scientific and policy analyses. The combina-
tion of modular encapsulation within the software architec-
ture and an open development paradigm allows for a bal-
ance between collaboration at multiple levels of simulation
detail and security of proprietary or sensitive data.
When comparing different nuclear fuel cycle concepts, it
can be a challenge to find any two systems analyses that com-
pare across a common set of metrics with a similar set of un-
derlying assumptions. Each analysis is likely to focus on a set
of metrics that are of interest to the team performing the analy-
sis and involve both implicit and explicit assumptions and con-
straints about the behavior of the fuel cycle system. While
a strict prescription of these metrics, assumptions and con-
straints could be proposed for comparison purposes, another
solution is to provide a systems analysis simulation tool that
provides sufficient modularity, extensibility and open access,
that it can be a basis for harmonzing to a common set. If it
becomes easier to modify an existing simulation tool to sup-
port the needs of a new analysis than it is to develop a new
tool, then it is possible that such a tool will be adopted more
universally for such analysis.},

term impact of alternative nuclear fuel cycles. The C YCLUS
core provides the infrastructure for an agent-based approach,
allowing user-provided modules to define the behavior of fuel
cycle facilities as they interact to exchange materials. An im-
portant consequence of this approach is that innovative facility
and material exchange concepts can be introduced to a consis-
tent framework allowing for more rigorous comparison. The
C YCLUS team has recently grown and now incorporates a vari-
ety of expertise: output visualization capability through collab-
oration with the University of Utah, server-client communica-
tion via the University of Idaho, input visualization and control
with the University of Texas - Austin, and social communica-
tion expertise through collaborators at UW-Madison to assist
the mission-critical goal of relevancy vis-{\`a}-vis policy makers.
Accordingly, the C YCLUS project is expanding efforts in the
realms of both structural capability and benchmarking calcula-
tions.
A series of once-through fuel cycle scenarios are being con-
ducted using the C YCLUS core and accompanying modules.
Where needed, additional modules have been added, includ-
ing a region model that intelligently makes building decisions
given a demand function. The results of these scenarios are
then compared with VISION [1] to provide a benchmark of
the C YCLUS results.},

	abstract = {The University of California, Berkeley (UCB), has developed a preconceptual design for a commercial pebble-bed (PB), fluoride salt{\textendash}cooled, high-temperature reactor (FHR) (PB-FHR). The baseline design for this Mark-I PB-FHR (Mk1) plant is a 236-MW(thermal) reactor. The Mk1 uses a fluoride salt coolant with solid, coated-particle pebble fuel. The Mk1 design differs from earlier FHR designs because it uses a nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle designed to produce 100 MW(electric) of base-load electricity using a modified General Electric 7FB gas turbine. For peak electricity generation, the Mk1 has the ability to boost power output up to 242 MW(electric) using natural gas co-firing. The Mk1 uses direct heating of the power conversion fluid (air) with the primary coolant salt rather than using an intermediate coolant loop. By combining results from computational neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and pebble dynamics, UCB has developed a detailed design of the annular core and other key functional features. Both an active normal shutdown cooling system and a passive, natural-circulation-driven emergency decay heat removal system are included. Computational models of the FHR-validated using experimental data from the literature and from scaled thermal-hydraulic facilities-have led to a set of design criteria and system requirements for the Mk1 to operate safely and reliably. Three-dimensional, computer-aided-design models derived from the Mk1 design criteria are presented.},

understanding of coexisting phases, as well as the transitions between them. In contrast, the theory fails with granular matter because
collisions between the grains dissipate energy, and their macroscopic size renders thermal fluctuations negligible. When a mass of
grains is subjected to mechanical vibration, it can make a transition to a fluid state. In this state, granular matter exhibits patterns and
instabilities that resemble those of molecular fluids. Here, we report a granular solid{\textendash}liquid phase transition in a vibrating granular
monolayer. Unexpectedly, the transition is mediated by waves and is triggered by a negative compressibility, as for van der Waals
phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. The dynamic behaviour
that we observe{\textemdash}coalescence, coagulation and wave propagation{\textemdash}is common to a wide class of phase transitions. We have combined
experimental, numerical and theoretical studies to build a theoretical framework for this transition.},

Authors highlight how they utilized particular tools, ideas, and practices to support reproducibility, emphasizing the very practical how, rather than the why or what, of conducting reproducible research.
 
Part 1 provides an accessible introduction to reproducible research, a basic reproducible research project template, and a synthesis of lessons learned from across the thirty-one case studies. Parts 2 and 3 focus on the case studies themselves. The Practice of Reproducible Research is an invaluable resource for students and researchers who wish to better understand the practice of data-intensive sciences and learn how to make their own research more reproducible.},

	shorttitle = {Moltres},
	doi = {10.21105/joss.00298},
	abstract = {Moltres is a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fueled molten salt reactors
(MSRs) (Lindsay et al. 2018). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and precursor
transport equations are set-up using an action system that allows the user to use an arbitrary
number of neutron energy and precursor groups respectively with minimal input
changes. Moltres sits on top of the Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(Gaston et al. 2015) and hence uses the finite element method to discretize the
governing partial differential equations. In general the resulting system of non-linear algebraic
equations is linearized using the Newton-Raphson method and then solved using
the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (Balay et al. 2017). Assembly
of the Jacobian and residual, and the linear solve are parallelized using MPI which
allows Moltres to be run in massively parallel environments. Runs on the Blue Waters
supercomputer at Illinois have utilized up to 608 cores.
Moltres and MOOSE allow use of different basis functions for different system variables.
Because of the purely diffusive nature of the neutron diffusion equations, neutron fluxes are
typically discretized using continuous first-degree Lagrange polynomials and the degrees of
freedom are associated with mesh nodes. The temperature variable may also be discretized
with a continuous Lagrange basis, or a discontinuous basis of arbitrary degree monomials
may be employed depending on the relative balance of heat convection to conduction. The
purely hyperbolic precursor transport is currently discretized using constant monomials,
which is equivalent to a first-order finite volume discretization. Moltres supports both
segregated (through Picard iteration) and monolithic solutions of the equation system.
However, due to the feedback between the power spectrum and temperature dependence
of macroscopic cross-sections, monolithic solves have demonstrated superior robustness
with segregated techniques often unable to converge to a solution. This result emphasizes
the importance of a fully coupled multi-physics framework like the one that Moltres and
MOOSE provide and suggests that iteratively coupling codes devoted to single physics
(K{\'o}ph{\'a}zi, Lathouwers, and Kloosterman 2009) may result in limited flexibility.},

The primary purpose of JOSS is to enable developers of research software to receive citation credit equivalent to typical archival publications. JOSS papers are deliberately extremely short, and are required to include a short abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, authors and their affiliations, and key references, as well as link to an archived version of the software (e.g., DOI obtained from Zenodo). Upon acceptance, papers receive a CrossRef DOI. Rather than a review of a lengthy software paper (including, e.g., methodology, validation, sample results), JOSS submissions undergo rigorous peer review of both the abstract and software itself, including documentation, tests, continuous integration, and licensing. The JOSS review process is modeled on the established approach of the rOpenSci collaboration. The entire submission and review process occurs openly on GitHub; papers not yet accepted remain visible and under review until the authors make appropriate changes for acceptance---unlike other journals, papers requiring major revision are not rejected. Since its public release in May 2016, JOSS has published 26 accepted papers as of September 2016, with an additional 20 submitted and under review.},

Additionally, we have developed an online reprocessing simulation tool, SaltProc which includes fission product removal, fissile material separations, and refuelling for time dependent analysis of fuel-salt evolution. Initial simulations of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment and the conceptual Molten Salt Breeder Reactor have been conducted on Blue Waters with deterministic multiphysics and Monte Carlo methods respectively. Steady state, transient, and fuel cycle analysis simulations have been run in 2D as well as 3D and compared against the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Fuel cycle dynamics and quasi-equilibrium compositions were obtained from depletion and reprocessing simulations for a 20-year time frame. The MSBR full-core safety analysis was performed at the startup and equilibrium fuel salt compositions, for important reactor safety parameters. In this work, conducted on Blue Waters, ARFC has demonstrated the capability to model complex physics in an advanced molten-salt-fueled nuclear reactor.},

The former is based on the point kinetics equations with six groups of delayed neutrons and the lumped capacitance heat transfer equations. To account for the reflector effect on neutron lifetime, additional (fictional) groups of delayed neutrons are added in the point kinetics equations to represent the thermalized neutrons coming back from the reflectors. The latter is based on coupled multi-group neutron diffusion and finite element heat transfer model.

For additional ease of use, it employs a reactor-agnostic, object-oriented data model, allowing nuclear engineers to rapidly prototype nuclear reactor control and safety systems in the context of their novel nuclear reactor designs.},

	title = {Investigation of {Agricultural} {Uses} of {Nuclear} {Waste} {Heat}. {UIUC} {Technical} {Report}. {October}, 2018.},
	abstract = {Nuclear power plants (NPPs) produce significant quantities of waste heat due to the low thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle. This waste heat carries roughly two-thirds of the total power generated at a nuclear power plant. It is responsibly released to the environment as a warm water flow, carrying with it a massive amount of low-grade thermal energy. As of now, this energy is lost from all Exelon NPPs. This waste heat is essentially a free source of energy and utilization projects offer the potential to significantly increase the thermal efficiency and profitability of centralized power generating stations, in particular NPPs.
Agricultural projects, particularly climate-controlled greenhouses, may show the most dramatic benefit from waste-heat utilization. Due to the relatively low temperature requirements of greenhouses, heating costs may be eliminated or cut substantially by the implementation of waste heat. The technical readiness of coupling central power generation station{\textquoteright}s waste heat discharge to climate-controlled greenhouses is high and has been demonstrated. Implementing this combined heat and power approach to Exelon{\textquoteright}s fleet of NPPs could offer significant advantages over fossil fueled power plants due to their high capacity factor, and strictly controlled and monitored water discharge.   
Exelon NPPs at Braidwood, Byron, Dresden, and Calvert Cliffs hold potential to supply significant agricultural waste heat. Few regulations exist specific to the use of waste heat from NPPs, but the discharge of waste heat from NPPs is strictly regulated, mitigating potential for regulatory hurdles to its use in other industries. Waste heat from Exelon{\textquoteright}s NPPs is an untapped and potentially lucrative commodity. In the Midwest, the location of Exelon{\textquoteright}s NPPs offers interesting opportunities for waste heat use in agriculture. The cold Midwest climate is normally a limiting factor in crop diversity and heated greenhouses are an option for overcoming this issue, but the heating costs are a barrier themselves. With cooperation between growers and the Exelon Corporation, waste heat may be commoditized while also facilitating more efficient and diverse growing operations. Waste heat use is not limited to farming operations. There are a host of industries that can benefit from waste heat use that may be local to other power plants. The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is located ideally to facilitate the farming of oysters with waste heat or even provide heat for liquefied natural gas vaporization. 
This report details a preliminary analysis to evaluate the potential for utilizing waste heat from NPPs. From the exhaustive review of past waste heat efforts, agricultural options, and primary economic and radiological factors, the technical readiness is shown to be high and the concept is sound. It is recommended that a detailed analysis should follow that includes: coupling candidate NPPs to specific greenhouse architectures, exploration of high-value crop options in prototypic and bounding event environments, and a detailed economic assessment.},

First, it is necessary to establish the dynamic  evolution of fuel composition via depletion and online reprocessing. Additionally, multiphysics analysis of the thermal hydraulics and neutronics in such a nuclear reactor must incorporate thermal feedbacks and material expansion feedbacks. Finally, drift of delayed neutron precursors must be incorporated into the kinetics analysis due to the mobility of the liquid fuel. This talk will discuss all three components. Toward the first component, a discussion of the SaltProc python package will establish the fuel composition dynamics capabilities necessary for fuel composition depletion in the context of online reprocessing. Toward the second component, a point kinetics model implementation in PyRK, and a more sophisticated advection model implementation in Moltres will be discussed, including neutron diffusion and precursor drift equations in Moltres as well as their implementation using the MOOSE action system. Finally, future directions for Moltres and SaltProc development will be noted.},

The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation.

This same goal could also be achieved by setting all the facility{\textquoteright}s ca- pacities to infinity. However, this does not reflect real-world conditions [1]. To address this gap in capability of fuel cycle simulators, the Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetype project (NEUP-FY16-10512) is developing prediction algorithms to give Cyclus demand-driven deployment capabilities. This means that Cyclus will have the capability to deploy sup- porting fuel cycle facilities to meet front-end and back-end demands of the fuel cycle. The project is a collaboration between the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of South Carolina. This paper will discuss the numerical experiments required to test the various prediction algorithms designed for the project.

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and MSR concepts has enhanced demand in building the tools to analyze these systems. This thesis introduces a Python script, SaltProc, which simulates MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. SaltProc couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. SaltProc capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled MSBR fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on MSBR operations; and (3) estimating MSBR fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the MSBR demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/GWh(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during MSBR operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},

	abstract = {Recent interest in advanced reactors and the following need for techno-economic transitions has increased the demand for tools necessary to model complex nuclear fuel cycles (NFCs) and advanced reactor technologies. This thesis demonstrates the capability of CYCLUS , the agent-based fuel cycle simulator, to model, simulate, and analyze real-life fuel cycle transition scenarios. I introduce new methods and tools that use various databases to model and simulate real-world nuclear fuel cycle transition scenarios involving advanced reactor technologies.

The work in this thesis contains: (1) benchmarking Cyclus to other nuclear fuel cycle simulators (NFC simulators); (2) developing new methods and tools necessary for modeling and simulating real-world fuel cycle transition scenarios; (3) simulation of both domestic and international nuclear technology transitions.

The methods and tools developed for such capabilities include: (1) modeling and simulating past and current nuclear fleets using historic nuclear reactor operations database; (2) modeling individual reactors and their operating history to calculate nuclear material inventory; (3) modeling Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) behavior in a large-scale fuel cycle simulation.

Benchmark work shows that CYCLUS results coincide with results from other NFC simulators with minor differences due to modeling choices. Additionally, this thesis demonstrates the CYCLUS capability to effectively model and simulate real-life NFC transition scenarios that involve advanced reactor technologies such as MSRs.},

	abstract = {In many fuel cycle simulators, the user must define a deployment scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid supply chain gaps. To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand-responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. Thus, a next-generation NFC simulator should predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined power demand. CYCLUS is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework [4]. In CYCLUS, each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the fuel cycle is an agent. Region agents represent geographical or political areas that institution and facility agents can be grouped into. Institution agents control the deployment and decommission of facility agents and represents legal operating organizations such as a utility, government, etc. Facility agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities. CYCAMORE provides agents to represent process physics of various components in the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment facility, reactor). The Demand-Driven CYCAMORE Archetypes project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop CYCLUS{\textquoteright} demand-driven deployment capabilities. This capability is added as a CYCLUS Institution agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. This demand-driven deployment capability is called d3ploy. In this paper, we explain the capabilities of d3ploy and demonstrate how d3ploy minimizes undersupply of all commodities in a few simulations while meeting key simulation constraints. Constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal power demand transition scenarios are demonstrated. Insights are discussed to inform parameter input decisions for future work in setting up larger transition scenarios that include many facilities. And finally, the more complex transition scenarios are demonstrated.},

	abstract = {The present United States nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identi ed four classes of nuclear fuel cycle options the U.S could transition to, which would overcome these challenges and make nuclear energy technology more desirable. The transitions have been modeled by various nuclear fuel cycle simulators. However, most fuel cycle simulators require the user to define a deployment
scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid any supply chain gaps, which becomes tedious for complex transition scenarios. This thesis developed a capability in Cyclus, a nuclear fuel cycle
simulator, to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This new capability successfully deployed fuel cycle facilities in a transition scenario from the current light water reactor fleet to a closed fuel cycle with continuous recycling of transuranics in fast and thermal reactors. In reality, these transition scenarios inevitably diverge from the modeled scenario. This work coupled the nuclear fuel cycle simulator tools, Cyclus and DYMOND, with Dakota, a
sensitivity analysis toolkit. This work conducted one-at-a-time, synergistic, and global sensitivity analysis with Cyclus-Dakota and DYMOND-Dakota, to understand the interdependence of input
parameters on the transition performance from the current light water reactor 
eet to a closed fuel cycle in which transuranics are recycled to fuel mixed oxide fuel thermal reactors and sodium fast-cooled reactors. The global sensitivity analysis concluded that the transition year input parameter was the most influential to the final depleted uranium and total idle reactor capacity performance
metrics, and the fleet share ratio and cooling time input parameters were the most influential to the final high level waste amount in the simulation. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis showed
that varying transition year from 80 to 84 years increased the final depleted uranium amount by 1.13\% and reduced the total idle reactor capacity by 10.36\%. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis also showed that varying fleet share ratio (mixed oxide fuel light water reactor: sodium fast-cooled reactor) from 0:100 to 20:80 reduced the final high level waste amount by 2\%, and varying the used fuel cooling time from 0 to 8 years reduced the final high level waste amount by 4\%. Therefore, an optimized transition scenario that minimizes final high level waste amount, final depleted uranium amount, and total idle capacity must have a fleet share ratio of 20:80, used fuel cooling time of 8
years, and a transition year at 83 years. This work compared Cyclus-Dakota's and DYMOND-Dakota's sensitivity analysis capabilities and concluded that automated deployment of supporting fuel cycle facilities is crucial for conducting sensitivity analyses with nuclear fuel cycle simulators, to ensure that the simulation adapts to the new parameters by minimizing idle reactor capacity.
The results demonstrated that time is saved if a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of a nuclear fuel cycle transition scenario begins with a global sensitivity analysis study to gain a general overview of the influential input variables for the performance metrics. Then, based on the global sensitivity analysis results, a reduced number of one-at-a-time and synergistic sensitivity analyses are conducted to determine quantitative trends and impacts of influential input variables on the performance metrics.},

	abstract = {As a result of the once-through fuel cycle implemented in the US, used nuclear fuel (UNF)
steadily increases. One proposed solution is the transition to a closed nuclear fuel cycle, in
which reprocessing reduces build up of UNF. Pyroprocessing is an attractive method for this
transition for its capabilities separating both light water reactor (LWR) and metallic fuels,
and inherent proliferation resistance. However, unlike aqueous reprocessing plants, industrial pyroprocessing plants do not yet exist. Similar to safety-by-design in next-generation
reactors, reprocessing facilities could be designed with safeguards in mind via safeguardsby-design. Without operational experience, these safeguards-by-design need to be derived
through modeling and simulation.
This thesis develops a medium fidelity generic model, Pyre, capable of simulating a variety
of pyroprocessing facility configurations. Pyre also simulates diversion via a diverter class
capable of tracking signatures and observables. Rather than only tracking exact material
production, we use signatures and observables such as operating temperature, pressure, and
current to mimic the capabilities of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections
and aid identification of nefarious fuel cycles, or shadow fuel cycles.
These capabilities are verified in a transition scenario of the current US fuel cycle to a
sodium fast reactor (SFR) based closed fuel cycle. Key operating parameters are determined
through sensitivity analysis of this scenario, monitoring isotopic changes in material unaccounted for. This work concludes that facility parameters which increase interaction between
the salt and waste have more impact on material unaccounted for (MUF). This work also
expands the state of the art by exploring the use of sub-facility modeling to increase fuel
cycle fidelity.},

The MSFR can adopt a closed thorium fuel cycle for sustainable operation through the breeding of 233 U from 232 Th. The fuel composition changes significantly over the course of its lifespan. In this study, we investigated the steady state and transient behavior of the MSFR using Moltres, a coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code developed within the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework. Three different fuel compositions, start-up, early-life, and equilibrium, were examined for potentially dangerous core temperature excursions during a unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS) accident. The six-group and total neutron flux distributions showed good agreement with SERPENT and published MSFR results, while the temperature distribution and total power showed discrepancies which can be attributed toknown sources of error. For the transient behavior under the ULOHS scenario, while the transition time towards the new steady state core temperature is also in good agreement with existing MSFR simulations by Fiorina et al., Moltres under-estimated the temperature rise by a factor of ten, due to the same sources of error affecting the steady state results. While an MSFR loaded with start-up fuel composition operates at a higher temperature than with the other two fuel compositions, all three cases were shown to be inherently safe due to thestrong negative temperature feedback.},

Costs drive the equation, but policies affecting electricity pricing also influence nuclear power revenues at a fundamental level. In current reactors and their associated fuel cycles, capital, operation, and maintenance costs increasingly dominate the economics of nuclear power.
Advanced reactor designs and fuel cycle choices can impact these costs both positively
and negatively. While fuel cycle advancements also impact fuel costs, this component has a relatively small impact on the overall cost of nuclear electricity production, particularly in comparison to capital costs. If advanced reactors can offer very high-temperature heat appropriate for industrial processing, natively couple with storage technologies, or can otherwise acheive load following behavior, then they may become more financially feasible than the current fleet.},

The active core of the SD-TMSR is divided into the inner zone (486 fuel tubes) and the outer zone (522 fuel tubes) to improve the Th-U3 breeding performance. This work adopted the SERPENT-2 Monte Carlo code to analyze the whole core model of the SD-TMSR. Built-in SERPENT-2 capabilities simulated online reprocessing and refueling and calculated the multiplication factor and Breeding Ratio (BR). We found that the molten salt Temperature Coefficient of Reactivity ($\alpha$T) was negative for initial and equilibrium states. This study investigated the variation of the multiplication factor, BR, and build-up of important nuclides in the core as a function of burnup. Under online reprocessing and refueling, we studied the variation of the reactivity during 60 years of reactor operation. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation was calculated. Finally, these simulations determined the appropriate 232Th and 233U feed rates for maintaining criticality and enabled analysis of the overall SD-TMSR fuel cycle performance.},

Given the abundance of WH from NPPs and the ubiquity of generally low-grade heat requirements of agricultural operations, from production to post-harvest, there is remarkable potential to harness NPP WH for agricultural uses with mutual economic advantages to NPPs and agricultural sectors. Taking advantage of this WH resource may improve the financial outlook of both the partnered power plants and agricultural businesses by providing an additional revenue stream, decreased heating costs, and a reduced carbon footprint. This review summarizes and interprets the historical discourse and research on agricultural applications of NPP WH in the U.S., and synthesizes technical constraints, unknowns, and opportunities for realizing the benefits of WH derived from the nuclear energy sector for agricultural value chains. Previous applications of WH in the agricultural industry demonstrate that this is a viable option to the benefit of the parties involved under the right conditions, but relatively little has been done to further this technology in the U.S. in recent years or explore novel applications. A revival of interest in this technology may be warranted given the current outlook for NPPs in the U.S. and a general interest in reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. Current MSR modeling efforts in the literature usually assume ideal (e.g., 100\% of neutron poison being removed) rather than realistically constrained removal efficiency. This work proposes to create a Python package, SaltProc, which will implement realistically constrained extraction efficiency of fission product based on physical models of fuel processing components appearing in various MSR systems. To demonstrate the capabilities of SaltProc, the Transatomic Power (TAP) concept will be simulated to capture the evolution of fuel salt composition during reactor operation with a realistic, physics-driven model of an online fuel reprocessing system. SaltProc will also be applied to determine the feasibility and safety of load following for the TAP system. This proposal outlines extensions to this work, including investigating safety parameters (temperature coefficients, shutdown margin, axial power offset) evolution over a 60-year reactor operation lifetime and during short-term load-following transients.},

	abstract = {Localizing a radiation source in an urban environment is a challenge in nuclear nonproliferation
and radiation detection. One approach to localize a source is to send a mobile radiation sensor
network into an area of interest to collect count rate measurements at many locations in an
attempt to find the radiation source. However, there are numerous temporal and spatial factors
that cause changes in background count rate measurements, and these factors make it challenging
to analyze the collected data. Displaying these measurements in a virtual environment has
contextualized them and helps a user determine if environmental factors are introducing false
positives. A virtual model has been shown to visualize collected measurements in near real-time,
but not in real-time. The ability for a user to quickly address alarm measurements is hampered
by this lack of real-time data access as well as due to poor quality virtual models.
Another challenge in radiation detection is sampling an environment to assess the status of an
area following a radiological or nuclear incident. Following an incident, environmental samples
must be collected and analyzed to identify the radioactive substances present and assess the
environmental damages. Incident response must be rapid and the sample collection must occur
without error. A software named Visual Sample Plan (VSP) has been developed by Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to help guide the sample collection process and
statistically inform decisions. This thesis begins with an overview of the radiation source search
and environmental sampling problems and how they have been addressed. Next, earlier work that
has attempted to address each of these problems and the motivation for these responses is
discussed. Finally, new work extending the prior solutions is discussed. To address the radiation
source search problem, a method to create higher quality 3D models is explored, and an alternate
method to store and retrieve data in the cloud using DynamoDB is implemented. By
implementing VSP in Augmented Reality (AR), opportunities for error are further limited. This
thesis concludes with suggestions for future work to approach robust solutions to each problem.},

	abstract = {The present U.S. nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options that make nuclear energy technology more desirable. Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This work introduces and demonstrates the demand-driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework. User-controlled capabilities such as time-series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. The demand-driven deployment capabilities are referred to as d3ploy. We demonstrate the capability of d3ploy to predict future commodities{\textquoteright} supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. Using d3ploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user simulation setup time compared to previous efforts that required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle facilities.},

	abstract = {Liquid-fueled Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) systems represent advances in safety, economics, and sustainability. The MSR has been designed to operate with a Th/233U fuel cycle with 233U used as startup fissile material. Since 233U does not exist in nature, we must examine other available fissile materials to start up these reactor concepts. This work investigates the fuel cycle and neutronics performance of the Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor (SD-TMSR) with different fissile material loadings at startup: High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) (19.79\%), Pu mixed with HALEU (19.79\%), reactor-grade Pu (a mixture of Pu isotopes chemically extracted from Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) spent nuclear fuel (SNF) with 33 GWd/tHM burnup), transuranic elements (TRU) from Light Water Reactor (LWR) SNF, and 233U. The MSR burnup routine provided by SERPENT-2 is used to simulate the online reprocessing and refueling in the SD-TMSR. The effective multiplication factor, fuel salt composition evolution, and net production of 233U are studied in the present work. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation is calculated. The results show that the continuous flow of reactor-grade Pu helps transition to the thorium fuel cycle within a relatively short time (?4.5 years) compared to 26~years for 233U startup fuel. Finally, using TRU as the initial fuel materials offers the possibility of operating the SD-TMSR for an extended period of time (?40~years) without any external feed of 233U.},

	abstract = {This research qualitatively reviews literature regarding energy system modeling in Japan specific to the future hydrogen economy, leveraging quantitative model outcomes to establish the potential future deployment of hydrogen in Japan. The analysis focuses on the four key sectors of storage, supplementing the gas grid, power generation, and transportation, detailing the potential range of hydrogen technologies which are expected to penetrate Japanese energy markets up to 2050 and beyond. Alongside key model outcomes, the appropriate policy settings, governance and market mechanisms are described which underpin the potential hydrogen economy future for Japan. We find that transportation, gas grid supplementation, and storage end-uses may emerge in significant quantities due to policies which encourage ambitious implementation targets, investment in technologies and research and development, and the emergence of a future carbon pricing regime. On the other hand, for Japan which will initially be dependent on imported hydrogen, the cost of imports appears critical to the emergence of broad hydrogen usage, particularly in the power generation sector. Further, the consideration of demographics in Japan, recognizing the aging, shrinking population and peoples\&rsquo; energy use preferences will likely be instrumental in realizing a smooth transition toward a hydrogen economy.},

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) performed a study in August 2019 to analyze the
neutronics behavior of the Transatomic Power Molten Salt Reactor (TAP MSR) core during
loadfollowing operations, culminating in the Milestone 3.1 Report [1] . As a follow-up to the previous
work, we will be analyzing the thermal-hydraulics behavior of the TAP MSR in this work.},

The primary purpose of JOSS is to enable developers of research software to receive citation credit equivalent to typical archival publications. Rather than a review of a lengthy software paper (including, e.g., methodology, validation, sample results), JOSS submissions undergo rigorous peer review of both the abstract and software itself, including documentation, tests, continuous integration, and licensing. The JOSS review process is modeled on the established approach of the rOpenSci collaboration. The entire submission and review process occurs openly on GitHub; articles not yet accepted remain visible and under review until the authors make appropriate changes for acceptance{\textemdash}unlike other journals, articles requiring major revision are not rejected. JOSS published 111 articles in its first year (May 2016{\textendash}2016), with {\textgreater}50 articles under review.},

	abstract = {Many nuclear power plants are at risk of shutting down due to a combination of policy decisions and financial strain [1]. Accurately predicting the generation from solar and wind may help minimize profit losses for nuclear power plants. Nu- clear power competes with natural gas to fulfill the net demand after accounting for renewable energy sources. Load following gives natural gas an economic edge over nuclear power be- cause natural gas plants can follow grid demand and even shut off when renewable penetration makes the price of electricity go negative [2]. It is possible for existing nuclear plants to load follow somewhat and some French nuclear plants have been retrofitted to follow daily variations in electricity demand [3]. As penetration of solar and wind energy increases around the world, load following will depend less on electric demand pro- files and more on renewable energy profiles. This shift makes load following with current nuclear power plants intractable [4]. Renewable energy challenges the base load electricity production that nuclear provides in the United States by in- troducing grid demand variability. Advanced reactor designs, like some Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), promise strong load following capabilities due to active 135Xe removal [5]. Unfor- tunately, the most mature MSR designs are at least a decade away from obtaining a commercial license in the United States. The climate crisis is too urgent to wait this long for nuclear power to become fully competitive with natural gas [6].
Variability has been the primary drawback for renewable energy sources like wind turbines, solar PV, and solar concen- trators, since their inception. This flaw worsens as renewable energy penetration increases [4]. Forecasting electricity pro- duction from renewable sources is therefore important for successful management of power systems [7]. Recent studies applied artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically multi- layer perceptrons, to the task of net load forecasting [7, 8, 9]. These studies made short term forecasts of 4-6 hours but nu- clear plants need accurate forecasts further ahead to facilitate load following. This study will be the first to apply Echo State Networks (ESNs) to the task of net load prediction.},

	abstract = {Recent studies on Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) showed that the excess reactivity at the beginning of the operation is large for many fueling strategies and must be compensated by a reactivity control system. The current work introduces a reliable safety system based on control rods in addition to the online feed system reactivity control in the Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor (SD-TMSR). Three different initial fissile loadings are considered: 233U, reactor-grade Pu, and transuranic (TRU) elements as a startup fuel. We applied six different absorbing materials to investigate the main operational and safety parameters in the SD-TMSR: natural B4C, enriched B4C with 90\% 10B, HfB2, HfH1.62, Eu2O3, and Gd2O3. The present work focuses on control rod design, integral and differential control rod worth, shutdown margin, and shadowing effects at steady-state. We employed the SERPENT-2 Monte-Carlo code to calculate the reactivity worth and analyze the performance of the reactivity control system. We showed that 233U and reactor-grade Pu startup cores maintain adequate shutdown margin with all considered absorbers. Finally, this paper proposes a design of control rod clusters that compensate the excess reactivity of the SD-TMSR loaded with different initial fissile material.},

	title = {Multi-{Physics} and {Technical} {Analysis} of {High}-{Temperature} {Gas}-{Cooled} {Reactors} for {Hydrogen} {Production}},
	copyright = {Copyright 2020 Roberto Fairhurst Agosta},
	abstract = {The future energy needs require the development of clean energy sources to ease the increasing environmental concerns. High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors have several desirable features that make them ideal candidates for the near-future large-scale deployment. Some of these features are a high temperature and high thermal cycle efficiency, which enable a wide range of process heat applications, such as hydrogen production. Implementing hydrogen economies can decarbonize the transport and power sectors, offering an alternative to ease climate change.
This work uses Moltres as the primary simulation tool. Although Moltres original development targeted Molten Salt Reactors, this work studies Moltres applicability to multi-physics simulations of prismatic High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors. Multi-physics simulations are necessary for assessing reactor safety characteristics. Ensuring
Moltres{\textquoteright} multi-physics modeling capabilities requires assessing the independent modeling capabilities of the different physical phenomena. Therefore, this thesis breaks down the analysis into three parts: stand-alone neutronics, stand-alone thermal-fluids, and coupled neutronics/thermal-fluids.
Regarding stand-alone neutronics, several analyses compare the results calculated by Moltres and Serpent on an MHTGR-350 model. The first analysis studies the energy group structure effects on the simulation of a fuel column. The results of the study suggest using a 15-energy group structure for attaining a desirable accuracy. The following analysis focuses on the full-core problem and compares different aspects of the simulations, concluding that Moltres obtains reasonably accurate results. The final study on stand-alone neutronics describes Moltres results of Phase I Exercise 1 of the OECD/NEA MHTGR-350 Benchmark. The benchmark exercise proved to be a modeling challenge, requiring the implementation of several approximations. For the most part, this thesis demonstrates Moltres{\textquoteright} capability to simulate stand-alone neutronics of prismatic High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors.
Regarding stand-alone thermal-fluids, several studies compare Moltres results to previously published results.
These studies focus on local models such as the unit cell and the fuel column problems, for which Moltres temperature results differ by less than 2\% from the published results. Further studies analyze the possibility of extending the thermal-fluids model implemented in the previous problems to a full-core simulation, finding a high memory
requirement imposed by the simulations. The full-core simulations focus on Phase I Exercise 2 of the benchmark, for which the implementation of a two-level approach in Moltres was necessary. The study{\textquoteright}s temperatures were within an 11.3\% difference to the published results, concluding that further analysis is required.
Regarding coupled neutronics/thermal-fluids, the analysis describes Phase I Exercise 3 of the benchmark. The exercise uses a simplified model that helps visualize some of the essential aspects of multi-physics simulations in Moltres. This exercise finds some areas of improvement in Moltres{\textquoteright} model and sets a basis for future work.
This thesis aligns with the University of Illinois{\textquoteright} goals to reduce carbon emissions from its campus{\textquoteright}s electricity generation and transportation sectors. This work focuses on two main analysis by introducing a nuclear reactor coupled to a hydrogen plant as a solution. The first analysis evaluates the conversion of the university fleet and the mass transit transport system in Urbana-Champaign to Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles. The second analysis investigates the duck curve phenomenon in the university{\textquoteright}s grid and introduces a mitigation strategy that may reduce the reliance on dispatchable sources. These studies emphasize how nuclear energy and hydrogen production can potentially mitigate climate change.},

New reactor designs, such as the Ultra Safe Nuclear Cor-poration (USNC) Micro Modular Reactor (MMR)TM, will require High Assay Low EnrichedUranium (HALEU) fuel enriched between 5-20\%.

Recovery and downblending of HEU fuel is lim-ited by the existing physical supply of HEU as well as downblending capacity.  Enrichment ofnatural uranium is limited by centrifuge capacity, in terms of Separative Work Unit (SWU).This work aims to quantify the resource requirements of the current U.S. reactor fleetand of the transition to different reactors that require HALEU fuel.

	copyright = {Copyright 2021 Anshuman Chaube},
	abstract = {In an effort to curb carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change, energy policymakers are considering advanced nuclear reactors as a potential source of clean base-load energy. Once such family of reactor designs is called the Molten Salt Reactor, which has been successfully demonstrated experimentally during the operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment(MSRE) at the Oak-Ridge National Laboratory during the 1960s. Thermal-hydraulic simulations of this reactor are an important step towards validating and verifying simulation tools for other molten salt reactor designs and exploring the potential of such reactors for licensing. Modern CFD simulations of the MSRE reactor core often discount the effects of turbulence in this reactor due to the low Reynolds number inside the MSRE channels. They also neglect the pyramidal tip at the top of the moderator graphite blocks called stringers. However, recent research indicates turbulence can play a significant role in compact reactor cores at relatively low Reynolds numbers. Our main concern is entrainment of fuel salt in recirculation zones and subsequent creation of localised hotspots. Therefore, we investigated the presence of such recirculation zones and the effect of the tip-shape on turbulence and stationary vortices in the upper plenum.
We analysed the flow around an MSRE graphite stringer using large eddy simulations performed in Nek5000. We also studied the effects of varying the size and shape of the stringer-tip using Nek5000{\textquoteright}s mesh deformation capabilities. To our knowledge, this work is the first effort to apply large eddy simulations to the MSRE and study the effects of geometry-induced turbulence and recirculation within the MSRE. We analysed the output data and found that salt recirculation vortices do exist and geometry and turbulence affect the salt flow in the upper plenum. But fuel salt recirculation does not impact the temperature of the salt or graphite significantly. We also determined the ideal tip-shape that minimises salt recirculation and entrapment. We found that a pyramidal tip with an apex half-angle of 45{\textopenbullet} disrupts recirculation, encourages mixing, and improves heat transfer, keeping salt and graphite temperatures low, whereas angles that are as small as 30{\textopenbullet} or large enough to tend towards a flat-top lead to hotter temperatures. Implications for the design and simulation of similar channel-type molten salt reactors are discussed.},

This report quantitatively explores how these closures would undermine economic and decarbonization goals in the state of Illinois, such as an aggressive target to achieve a zero carbon electric grid by 2030.
Previous energy systems research has shown that such clean energy goals cannot be reached if nuclear plants prematurely retire [2, 3, 4]. In particular, the February 2021 National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine consensus report, {\textquotedblleft}Accelerating Decarbonization of the U.S. Energy System,{\textquotedblright} determined unequivocally that US decarbonization will require keeping existing nuclear plants open [2]. Consistent with that liter- ature, our simulations indicate that decarbonization in Illinois will require not only maintenance but expansion of nuclear energy capacity.},

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic Power (TAP) MSR. A Python toolkit, SaltProc v0.1 [1{\textendash}3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). More recently, an advanced SaltProc version (SaltProc v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the TAP system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards milestone M2.1: Demonstrate SaltProc and the steps toward the subsequent Task 2 objectives.},

To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. In this work, we develop demand driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, d3ploy. User-controlled capabilities such as supply/ capacity buffers, constraint deployment, prediction algorithms, and installed capacity deployment were introduced in d3ploy to give a user the tools to minimize commodity undersupply in a simulation.

Critically, our simulations incorporate novel technologies like hydrogen electrolysers, carbon capture, photochemical water splitting, and emerging photovoltaic cells, assess long-term impacts up to the year 2100, and include life-cycle emissions and learning curves for parameters such as investment cost, efficiency, and emission coefficients. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, using nuclear power and hydrogen from renewable energy-based electrolysis, is cost-effective and provides long-term emission reduction along with energy security. Nuclear, wind, solar, and hydrogen from renewables emerge as key emission reduction technologies, while natural gas with carbon capture plays a minor role in achieving emission reduction targets.},

Benchmark phases I-A and I-B involve reactor physics analysis of a representative fuel element, without and with depletion. Several configurations are considered (e.g., unrodded and rodded configuration, presence of burnable absorbers, variable enrichment). Parameters compared include multiplication factor, reactivity coefficients, flux distribution, neutron spectrum and isotopic composition change with burnup. Seven organizations from four countries are taking part in this blind-benchmark exercise, using Monte Carlo and deterministic methods. Given the complex combination of materials and geometry, the FHR benchmark is expected to be challenging, particularly for deterministic codes. As the nuclear data libraries underpinning both deterministic and Monte Carlo methods have had limited testing for FHR systems, and molten salt systems in general, the benchmark aims to provide feedback to both the nuclear data community as well as molten salt reactor designers with regards to the variance of results with different nuclear data sources. This paper reports on the current results submitted and provides comparisons and analysis. Overall, the observed agreement is satisfactory, although notable differences are identified in specific cases, suggesting need for further in-depth analysis of those cases.},

Through rigorous multivariate statistical evaluation of cultural groupings, income and education on energy system preferences and lived experience, we identified cultural groups that experience energy affordability differently, irrespective of income or educational achievement. For energy policy issue and factor importance, we identify a positive link with educational achievement and income, varying across cultural grouping. Overall, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders and American Indian and Native Alaskans had a muted response to energy policy issues and energy system factors compared to their peers. Our findings identified a need to enhance overall educational outcomes to engender more positive attitudes toward improving the environment, and the need for policy makers to be aware of cultural group preferences to enable development of energy policies which improve recognition justice outcomes.},

	abstract = {The nuclear power industry must overcome cost and safety challenges to ensure continued
global use and expansion of nuclear energy technology to provide low-carbon electricity
worldwide. The Generation IV International Forum identi ed six nuclear reactor systems
that promise signi cant advances in safety, sustainability, e ciency, and cost over existing
designs. The Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor (FHR) system, speci cally
the Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) design, combines the best aspects of two
identi ed Generation IV systems: Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) and Very-High-Temperature
Reactor (VHTR). The AHTR uses the MSR's low-pressure liquid fluoride-salt coolant and
VHTR's high-temperature coated-particle fuel. The AHTR's fuel geometry has triple het-
erogeneity, resulting in complex reactor physics and signi cant modeling challenges. To
further understand and address the technical challenges associated with the AHTR de-
sign, this work proposes participation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development-Nuclear Energy Agency's FHR benchmarking exercise by modeling its neutron-
ics and thermal-hydraulics with OpenMC and Moltres nuclear software. In the proposed
work, I will also explore the impact of additive manufacturing technology advancements
on reactor geometry optimization, speci cally for the AHTR design. Leveraging additive
manufacturing technology enables us to surpass classical manufacturing constraints, such as
straight fuel channels or homogenous fuel enrichment, and optimize for arbitrary geometries
and parameters such as non-uniform channel shapes and inhomogeneous fuel distribution
throughout the core. This work proposes to design and demonstrate an optimization tool
that uses the evolutionary algorithm optimization technique with neutron transport and
thermal-hydraulics software to find new optimal reactor geometries enabled by additive
manufacturing technology.},

As a MOOSE-based application, Moltres provides various multiphysics coupling schemes and time-stepping methods, including fully coupled solves with implicit time-stepping. We verified Moltres{\textquoteright} MSR modeling capabilities against a multiphysics numerical benchmark developed for software dedicated to modeling fast-spectrum MSRs. The results show that Moltres performed comparably to participating software packages in the benchmark; the majority of the relevant quantities fell within one standard deviation of the benchmark average. Among the participating multiphysics tools in the benchmark, Moltres agrees closest to the multiphysics tool from the Delft University of Technology due to similarities in the numerical solution techniques and meshing schemes.},

	abstract = {Decarbonizing the United States energy system is a challenging task. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of strong federal climate policy, leaving individual states and institutions to drive the energy sector towards net-zero carbon emissions. ESOM tools use linear programming to develop policy insights that may help achieve full decarbonization. However, there is a widely recognized tradeoff between model complexity and computational cost. Adding spatial, temporal, and technological details make these models more realistic, but may make them computationally intractable. Previously, most ESOM studies prioritize technology options over spatial or temporal detail. This choice emphasizes the role of technology costs, such as fuel and capital costs, on energy policy without considering operational challenges. This thesis uses the ESOM, Temoa to model Illinois{\textquoteright} and the University of Illinois{\textquoteright} energy systems and develops the PyGenesys tool to facilitate sensitivity analysis. The sensitivities considered in this work are temporal resolution and the annual capacity factors of wind and solar energy, or the inter-annual variability.

The results of the time resolution study showed that any temporal aggregation above an hourly level may generate misleading results that minimizes the roles of firm clean power and energy storage. Additionally, the role of wind energy is overestimated in models with less temporal detail, and the roles of solar energy and advanced nuclear reactors are underestimated. The study of inter-annual variability showed that energy systems with majority variable intermittent renewables, such as solar and wind, that exclude clean firm power from nuclear power plants exhibit higher energy costs with nearly 63 times the variance of systems that use a majority of clean firm power. Additionally, the amount of capacity necessary to meet electricity demand is greater and more uncertain in systems with high renewable penetration. Finally, based on the results in each of the sensitivity analyses, this thesis recommends that Illinois continues supporting its existing nuclear fleet with {\textquotedblleft}zero emissions credits{\textquotedblright} and expand clean firm capacity with advanced nuclear reactors by lifting the moratorium on new nuclear builds.},

	abstract = {No operating molten salt reactors (MSRs) exist, so we must rely on computer simulations to study this technology. Popular MSR designs to use in simulations include the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR), the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). A key process to consider for MSRs is on-line fuel reprocessing and its effect on reactor dynamics. SaltProc is an open source interface code tool that simulates on-line fuel reprocessing when coupled with a depletion-capable transport solver. SaltProc was intended to be usable with any depletion solver, but initially was written with support for Serpent2 exclusively. In this work, the SaltProc codebase was overhauled to simplify coupling to depletion solvers. Support for OpenMC was also added. To ensure that the code maintained existing functionality as well as extended it, the new functionality was validated on a full-core model of the MSBR. The results indicate that keff between OpenMC and Serpent2 differ by +35 pcm at beginning of life and by 700 pcm at the end of the simulation after one year of operation. Additionally, the relative difference of most actinides is less than 2\%. The actinides with smaller concentrations in the fuel tend to have larger relative differences between the two codes. The results for fission products are similar, however, the relative differences are smaller, with most of the fission products having a relative difference no greater than 0.6\%. There are some outliers in the results with very high relative errors, however, these can be attributed to numerical errors. This is significant as this makes SaltProc the first completely open-source tool to flexibly and accurately simulate on-line fuel reprocessing.},

	title = {Enabling {Load} {Following} {Capability} in the {Transatomic} {Power} {MSR}},
	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1877339},
	abstract = {This project is dedicated towards designing a fuel processing system that enables liquid-fueled molten salt reactors (MSR) to load follow by removing the dissolved xenon in the fuel salt. As one of the Gen-IV nuclear reactor concepts, the molten salt reactor receives increasing development interests in the recent years. One distinguishing feature of the liquid-fueled molten salt reactor is its improved ability to operate in a load-following mode by including the unique online fission product removal system. Load-following means that the reactor changes its power output based on the demand on the grid. Most of the current operating nuclear reactors have limited load-following ability and operate as the base load on the grid. Due to the rapid increase of solar energy, the requirement on load-following capacity is significantly increased because of the varying power output of the solar panels, yet the traditional load-following capacity is expected to decrease as the decarbonization of the grid continues. Therefore, the ability to perform load-following operation for the nuclear reactors will greatly enhance the resilience of the grid and make nuclear energy more economically competitive. This load-following feature is included in many commercial molten salt reactor designs, such as the designs by Transatomic Power, Terrestrial Energy, and Flibe Energy. Unfortunately, detailed analysis of the fuel processing system for commercial scale MSRs is still lacking, as well as how the fuel processing quantitively impacts the load-following operation. Moreover, experimental data for many of the underlying physics of fuel processing is limited. This project aims to pave the way for the fuel processing technology to advance to the commercial stage by performing combined experimental and simulation research. During the project period, four interconnected aspects of the development of the fuel processing system in liquid-fueled molten salt reactors are investigated. These aspects are the simulation and analysis of the fission product removal system, the fuel cycle simulation, the coupled reactor neutronics and thermal hydraulics transient simulation, and the gaseous fission product removal experiment. Multiphase CFD simulations are performed for components of the processing systems, and simplified air-water experiments are carried out to provide validation data. It is concluded that the CFD simulation can satisfactorily predict the system level performance of the components, and engineering models are constructed based on this success. Fuel cycle analysis is performed for two representative MSR design, the MSBR and the Transatomic Power MSR. Open-source code SaltProc is developed to incorporate the unique fuel processing system of the MSRs. It is concluded that the removal of xenon is essential for load-following operation in thermal spectrum MSR and Molten Salt Breeder Reactor. For the Transatomic Power MSR, the xenon poisoning effect is negligible due to its relatively fast neutron spectrum, though the overall fuel cycle economics still benefits from the removal of xenon. Coupled reactor neutronics and thermal hydraulics transient simulation is performed specifically for the Transatomic Power MSR. It is concluded that the reactor core design could perform power ramping fast enough to satisfy load-following operation. Combining the findings from each aspect, it is concluded that the load-following operation of a thermal neutron MSR is dependent upon the removal of xenon, which could be achieved for a commercial sized reactor using continuous inert gas sparging in a separate system with reasonable dimensions.},

	abstract = {Fuel cycle simulator development started many years ago by several research and engineering institutions or consulting firms for a wide range of applications. To improve confidence in the results, institutions may be tempted to increase the complexity of their software even if this complexity might not be necessary. On the other hand, some simulators may be used outside their range of validity when used in very specific applications. The FIT (Functionality Isolation Test) project is an international effort devoted to improve the confidence in the data produced by fuel cycle simulation tools. The scientific goal is to determine the optimum level of detail a fuel cycle simulator needs according to the type of study and the required confidence level. The project relies on a wide variety of fuel cycle simulators with a large range of complexity levels. The FIT project consists of isolating the impact of one targeted functionality on fuel cycle simulations. The impact of the functionality is assessed using a set of simple basic exercises specifically designed for this purpose, called {\textquotedblright}functionality isolation.{\textquotedblright} The present work focuses on the impact on simulation results of using a fuel loading model (a relation that links the stock isotopic composition with the fresh fuel fabrication according to the reactor requirements) or a fixed fraction approach (the fresh fuel fissile fraction is fixed and does not depend on the stock isotopic composition). The paper first presents the FIT project. The exercise design is described and results show that using a fuel loading model approach has an important impact on fuel cycle outputs under certain conditions that are described. This result is reinforced by the fact that all fuel cycle simulators used in this exercise provide similar conclusions.},

	abstract = {Science gateways are a crucial component of critical infrastructure as they provide the means for users to focus on their topics and methods instead of the technical details of the infrastructure. They are defined as end-to-end solutions for accessing data, software, computing services, sensors, and equipment specific to the needs of a science or engineering discipline and their goal is to hide the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. Science gateways are often called Virtual Research Environments in Europe and Virtual Labs in Australasia; we consider these two terms to be synonymous with science gateways. Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have found applications in many different fields in private industry, and private industry has reaped the benefits. Likewise, in the academic realm, large-scale data science applications have also learned to apply public high-performance computing resources to make use of this technology. However, academic and research science gateways have yet to fully adopt the tools of AI. There is an opportunity in the gateways space, both to increase the visibility and accessibility to AI/ML applications and to enable researchers and developers to advance the field of science gateway cyberinfrastructure itself. Harnessing AI/ML is recognized as a high priority by the science gateway community. It is, therefore, critical for the next generation of science gateways to adapt to support the AI/ML that is already transforming many scientific fields. The goal is to increase collaborations between the two fields and to ensure that gateway services are used and are valuable to the AI/ML community. This chapter presents state-of-the-art examples and areas of opportunity for the science gateways community to pursue in relation to AI/ML and some vision of where these new capabilities might impact science gateways and support scientific research.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a robust approach to quickly design a nuclear reactor core and explores the best performing machine learning (ML) technique for predicting feature parameters of the core. We implemented the approach into a hypothetical channel of molten salt reactors to demonstrate the applicability of the method. We prepared a Python tool, named Plankton, which couples to a reactor physics code and an optimization tool, and imports ML methods. The tool performs three consecutive phases: reactor database generation, machine learning application, and design optimization. We identified the extra trees method as the best performing estimator. With the estimator, we found nine optimum designs in total, one for each fuel-salt pair, and estimated all the performance metrics of the designs with a {\textless}5\% prediction error compared to their actual values. U-Pu-NaCl fuel-salt gave promising results with the highest conversion ratio, the most negative feedback coefficient, and the lowest fast flux.},

	url = {https://www.eesi.org/briefings/view/041923nuclear},
	abstract = {The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) within the Department of Energy (DOE) works to advance nuclear energy science and technology to meet U.S. energy, environmental, and economic needs. NE focuses on research and development (R\&D) that prioritizes the continued operation of the current fleet of nuclear reactors, building new reactors, securing and sustaining the nuclear fuel cycle, and expanding international nuclear cooperation.
The R\&D budget of NE supports nuclear science and technology missions by national laboratories, universities, and industry.
Stopping the premature closure of existing nuclear power plants due to economic reasons can save gigawatts of clean firm power on the grid.
Nuclear energy is the largest source of carbon-free energy in the United States. It accounts for 18 percent of all electricity generated and 47 percent of all carbon emissions-free electricity in the United States.
R\&D programs enhance the performance of nuclear energy plants, extend their lifetime, reduce operating costs, and develop advanced fuels.
Historically, conventional nuclear power plants run at single power, at baseload, and cannot vary their generation. However, advanced nuclear technology provides many opportunities for reactors to vary in power to complement renewable energy facilities. Advanced nuclear technology also provides thermal storage capabilities that allow reactors to stay at high temperatures while the amount of electricity they dispatch to the grid can vary.
Developing small modular reactors (SMRs) and micro-reactors will offer siting flexibility, scalability, and energy uses beyond electricity. With less space required for emergency planning zones, SMRs can be more suitable for environments like repurposed retired and retiring fossil fuel plants.
NE is developing micro-reactors for off-grid communities and backup power, the kind of situations that diesel generators often address.
There are a number of communities and assets across the country that we cannot leave behind in the transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Nuclear reactors are especially suited to leveraging grid, workforce, and other assets at retiring or retired coal plant sites.
Repurposing unabated fossil plants could deliver place-based solutions to advance an equitable energy transition.
A recent DOE study shows that 80 percent of U.S. coal communities could benefit from replacing their coal plants with nuclear ones. Each community could gain 650 new permanent jobs, additional economic activity of \$275 million, and an 86 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Leveraging existing infrastructure would reduce total system costs.
The DOE has recently released reports on long-duration energy storage, clean hydrogen, and commercializing advanced nuclear.
To get to the net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 goal, the buildout of nuclear energy will need to be aggressive. Clean firm power will be necessary to support variable renewable energy.
To secure and sustain the global nuclear fuel cycle, conversion and enrichment capacity must be expanded, a strategy for integrated waste management of spent nuclear fuel must be developed, and consent-based approaches to siting interim storage facilities must be implemented.
A consent-based siting approach would consolidate the 70 locations across the country where communities are currently hosting spent nuclear fuel but never agreed to host it for the long term. The DOE was supposed to take title of this fuel in 1988.
This consent-based approach prioritizes people and communities; seeks willing and informed consent; is flexible, adaptive, and collaborative; is responsive to community concerns; centers equity and environmental justice; and is informed by public feedback.
NE supports R\&D cooperation across borders to ensure research focuses on peaceful uses of nuclear power as well as to ensure the ability of the United States to have a voice in global leadership on this topic.},

	abstract = {Methods for deep-penetration radiation transport remain important for radiation shielding, nonproliferation, nuclear threat reduction, and medical applications. As these applications become more ubiquitous, the need for accurate and reliable transport methods appropriate for these systems persists. For such systems, hybrid methods often obtain reliable answers in the shortest time by leveraging the speed and uniform uncertainty distribution of a deterministic solution to bias Monte Carlo transport and reduce the variance in the solution. This work reviews the state of the art among such hybrid methods. First, we summarize variance reduction (VR) for Monte Carlo radiation transport and existing efforts to automate these techniques. Relations among VR, importance, and the adjoint solution of the neutron transport equation are then discussed. Based on this exposition, the work transitions from theory to a critical review of existing VR implementations in modern nuclear engineering software. At present, the Consistent AdjointDriven Importance Sampling (CADIS) and Forward-Weighted Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling (FW-CADIS) hybrid methods are the gold standard by which to reduce the variance in problems that have deeply penetrating radiation. The CADIS and FW-CADIS methods use an adjoint scalar flux to generate VR parameters for Monte Carlo radiation transport. Additionally, efforts to incorporate angular information into VR methods for Monte Carlo are summarized. Finally, we assess various implementations of these methods and the degree to which they improve VR for their target applications.},

	abstract = {The multigroup neutron transport equations has been widely used to study the interactions of neutrons with their background materials in nuclear reactors. High-resolution simulations of the multigroup neutron transport equations using modern supercomputers require the development of scalable parallel solving techniques. In this paper, we study a scalable transport method for solving the algebraic system arising from the discretization of the multigroup neutron transport equations. The proposed transport method consists of a fully coupled Newton solver for the generalized eigenvalue problems and GMRES together with a novel multilevel domain decomposition preconditioner for the Jacobian system. The multilevel preconditioner has been successfully used for many problems, but the construction of coarse spaces for certain problems, especially for unstructured mesh problems, is expensive and often unscalable. We introduce a new subspace-based coarsening algorithm to address this issue by exploring the structure of the matrix in the discretized version of the neutron transport problems. We numerically demonstrate that the proposed transport method is highly scalable with more than 10,000 processor cores for the 3D C5G7 benchmark problem on unstructured meshes with billions of unknowns. Compared with the traditional multilevel domain decomposition method, the new approach equipped with the subspace-based coarsening algorithm is much faster on the construction of coarse spaces.},

	abstract = {Zapdos is an open-source finite element plasma fluid solver based on the MOOSE multiphysics framework. This paper outlines Zapdos verification, benchmarking, and validation efforts for 1D and 2D RF capacitively-coupled plasma discharge models for mid-range pressures (0.1 - 1 Torr). The verification process involved using the method of manufactured solutions to assess Zapdos spatial and temporal error convergence. L2 errors ranged from 10-2 to 10-4, while the convergence's slope were in agreement with the predicted slopes for the tested variable and time integration orders. The benchmarking process involved comparisons to previously results from the validated finite element code, LSODI [1], [2], [3]. These works included 1D and 2D simulations for a range of plasma parameters (densities, temperatures, voltage, etc.). For the 1D cases, Zapdos and LSODI results were in very good agreement. In the 2D cases, variable behaviors matched, with slight discrepancies in peak values. The validation process involved comparisons to experimental works including electron density measurements by microwave interferometry [4] and metastable density measurements by planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging [5]. Results shown reasonable agreement at higher pressure, with results starting to diverge at low pressures. Probable causes for this diverges are the limitation of the fluid assumption for plasmas at low pressure, or the need for more robust boundary conditions. Overall, Zapdos shown reasonable results for the verification, benchmarking, and validation efforts, and Zapdos can be downloaded at https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos.
Program summary
Program Title: Zapdos CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/j76jr9m66p.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos Licensing provisions: LGPL-2.1 Programming language: C++, Python Supplementary material: shannon-lab.github.io/zapdos Nature of problem: For the plasma computational community, multiphysics packages are needed for the highly couple physics seen in plasma problems (e.g. chemistry, fluid flow, heat transfer, electromagnetic, etc.). One limiting factor for these types of computational research is the high cost to purchase the licenses needed for established multiphysics packages, such as COMSOL. An additional problem that can arise is the limited ability to add new physics to these existing frameworks, in such a way that new physics can be easily coupled to current models. For any new software that wants to tackle these problems, the question of verification and validation for these codes needs to be addressed. Solution method: Zapdos is an open-source finite element plasma fluid solver based on the MOOSE multiphysics framework. MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) solves highly nonlinear, tightly coupled sets of partial differential equations (PDEs) and houses multiple physics applications that can be easily coupled together. Zapdos, along with the MOOSE ecosystem, is all free, open-source, and completing customizable with no black box components. Zapdos has gone through verification and validation for applications common in the plasma computational community. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Zapdos, along with MOOSE and other MOOSE applications, require an Unix based operating system.},

	abstract = {During the fiscal year of 2021, the finite-volume method (FVM) was deployed in Pronghorn to provide improved efficiency, stability, and accuracy for coarse-mesh, thermal-hydraulics problems. While the main goals of fiscal year 2021 were met, several issues emerged from the early deployment of the finite-volume method in Pronghorn. These issues were: The compressible and incompressible formulations that were implemented are inadequate for many nuclear reactor flow problems; Omission of terms accounting for the porosity and Darcy-Forchheimer body force discontinuities in the Rhie-Chow interpolation lead to oscillations in pressure and velocity at these discontinuities; The FVM lacks a correction for non-orthogonal grids for computing accurate pressure gradient leading to loss of accuracy in regions with skewed elements; The FVM currently uses a monolithic solver. Monolithic solvers have issues dealing with the saddle-point nature of the discretized fluid equations. The result are bad convergence if direct factorization is not used and large memory consumption when direct factorization is used. These four issues are addressed in this report. In particular, we report the completion of the following task: Implementation of a weakly compressible formulation in the MOOSE Navier-Stokes module; Implementation of Moukalled{\textquoteright}s method for including body forces in the RCI. Additionally, we identified the need to smooth the porosity using Moukalled{\textquoteright}s face-cell smoothing operator; Implementation of a non-orthogonal correction for the Green-Gauss gradient computation; Preliminary implementation of a SIMPLE segregated solver.},

	abstract = {Usage of contact mechanics methodologies is a pervasive modeling requirement in dynamic simulations. While for some trivial problems, solutions taken from analytical geometry are available, use of a finite element framework is common to achieve formulation generality. This work explores two dynamic contact formulations: one based on the traditional node-to-segment (NTS) approach, and a variationally consistent segment-to-segment (STS) mortar formulation. The NTS formulation employed here enforces the constraints kinematically (i.e., the interpenetration is enforced to the solver tolerance), whereas the mortar approach uses Lagrange multipliers to enforce the contact constraints. Both approaches are implemented in the open-source finite element framework Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). The results highlight two relevant contact-interface-related dynamic phenomena in finite element simulations. First, stabilization of contact constraints is discussed, taking into account the evolution of the total energy in a benchmark problem. Second, the influence of finite element discretization on both of the aforementioned contact formulations is analyzed by exercising a large-deformation example with continuous relative sliding. Variationally consistent contact approaches such as the mortar formulation lead to improved energy preservation and avoid spurious excitation of the system's frequencies. This is especially relevant in settings where inertia and vibrations are of importance.},

Support through this process is provided through the MOOSE Google Group message board. The workshop itself will consist of interactive modules where instructors from the MOOSE development team will work with attendees to build a simple plasma model. Each module will build on previous modules to introduce fundamental MOOSE features that will combine to demonstrate simulation capabilities for low temperature plasma modeling. The intention is not to provide an exhaustive overview of simulation capabilities but to instead provide attendees with the necessary tools to build unique simulation capabilities for their specific research challenges. Users should attend the workshop with laptop computers with MOOSE installed to allow for interactive instruction. At the completion of the workshop attendees will be able to install and run MOOSE and associated applications as well as carry out plasma simulations studies.},

	abstract = {Fusion reactors depend on the blanket material to breed and release tritium at the same rate or faster than it is consumed by the fusion reaction. Cellular ceramic breeders (CCBs) are dense materials that can maintain a high tritium breeding ratio while promoting tritium release because of highly connected pores. Assessing the tritium breeding capabilities of these materials requires a combination of extensive experimental and modeling efforts. In this work, we develop and calibrate a multiphysics model of tritium transport. This novel model accounts for ceramic and pore diffusion, trapping and detrapping, and several surface reactions at the pore surface. We perform a sensitivity analysis and calibrate the model by comparing its predictions against experimental measurements of deuterium absorption. The calibrated model is then used to model tritium absorption in samples with different pore microstructures to investigate the effect of pore interconnectivity on tritium absorption. The model is part of the development of the multiscale, multiphysics framework for tritium transport [i.e., the Tritium Migration Analysis Program (TMAP8)], which is itself built on top of the finite-element multiphysics framework multiphysics object-oriented simulation environment (MOOSE). This study demonstrates some of TMAP8{\textquoteright}s capabilities and is the first step toward assessing the tritium breeding capabilities of ceramic breeder material designs.},

The usage of this module in multiple recent studies coupled with the growing interest in moose for usage in nonlight water reactor safety studies by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) prompted the authors to investigate the computational fluid dynamics capabilities of moose. A two-dimensional laminar flow past a circular cylinder scenario is simulated in the moose framework to investigate the effectiveness of the N{\textendash}S module. Simulations assumed an unsteady laminar flow with a Reynolds number of 200. To verify the results from moose, similar simulations were conducted using the well-utilized simulation of turbulent flow in arbitrary regions{\textemdash}computational continuum mechanics C++ (star-ccm+) finite volume code. Results from both codes are also compared to some results from literature. Velocity and pressure profiles of both transient simulations were compared. The numerical and input errors in moose are also visualized with contour plots to qualitatively understand the evolution of the errors across time and space. The comparisons between moose and star-ccm+ showed nearly perfect agreement between the codes for velocity and pressure, especially after the development of the vortex street in later time-steps. The force coefficients showed excellent agreement after the development of the vortex street, but demonstrated notable discrepancies prior to the vortex street development, which is likely due to how each code simulated the approach to the vortex street in earlier time-steps.},

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1467562},
	abstract = {Early in its development, the primary emphasis of efforts to improve the Bison fuel performance code were focused on initial development of new capabilities. As Bison has matured and become adopted by a wider set of users, it has become clear that a number of robustness issues needed to be addressed to ensure that the code can reliably produce a converged solution. This need became particularly evident when a recent effort by Westinghouse Electric Company to simulate all of the fuel rods in a reactor using Bison resulted in approximately 30\% of the models failing to run to completion because of lack of convergence or other errors that were encountered. It is important to emphasize that there was no evidence that Bison generated results that were incorrect for the set of models exercised. In many cases, issues such as those encountered could be addressed by adjusting solver-related parameters. However, there is no question that for Bison to become widely adopted for production work, it needs to be inherently far more robust than it was. Because of this, a concerted effort was undertaken to improve Bison's robustness, or its ability to reliably obtain converged solutions under a wider variety of conditions. As a result of this work, a number of high-priority areas for improvement for modeling light water reactor (LWR) fuel rods have been identified and addressed. As a result of this work, the number of failing Bison analyses in the aforementioned set of simulations for a full core has been reduced to a fraction of a percent. In addition, the robustness of Bison models using the VERA core simulator has been significantly improved. This is important because all of the Bison models representing individual fuel rods must run to completion successfully for the full core model to run to completion. This report provides summaries of the identified sources of robustness issues in Bison and the development that was done to resolve these issues. It also summarizes the addition of new capabilities to address deficiencies in Bison's ability to include needed aspects of LWR fuel behavior, and improvements that were made to improve Bison's solution efficiency.},

	abstract = {The multigroup neutron transport equation is crucial for studying the motion of neutrons and their interaction with materials. Numerical simulation of the multigroup neutron transport equation is computationally challenging because the equation is defined on a high-dimensional phase space, the computational spatial domain is complex, and the materials are heterogeneous. A scalable parallel solver is required to address such a challenge. In this paper, we study a highly parallel Newton--Krylov--Schwarz (NKS) method consisting of a Newton-based eigenvalue solver, a Krylov subspace method, and a novel multilevel Schwarz preconditioner. The multilevel method is one of the most popular preconditioners for accelerating neutron transport calculations, but the construction of coarse spaces can be expensive and often unscalable when a large number of processors is used. We propose a novel matrix coarsening algorithm in which a multilevel hierarchy is constructed using a single-component matrix instead of the full matrix of the neutron transport equation. This new coarsening algorithm is referred to as {\textquotedblleft}subspace-based coarsening.{\textquotedblright} Above 8,000 processors, we show a 13x enhancement in multilevel preconditioner setup time when using the subspace-based coarsening method. A partition-based balancing strategy is studied to enhance the parallel efficiency of the NKS algorithm by equalizing the work for each processor. A hierarchical mesh partitioning algorithm is employed to generate a large number of submeshes while minimizing off-node communication. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is scalable with more than 10,000 processors for a realistic application on three-dimensional unstructured meshes with a few billion degrees of freedom. Neutron transport calculations using the improved NKS algorithm are twice as fast as those based on the unmodified NKS solver when over 8,000 processors are employed.},

	abstract = {The acoustic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) formulation is a practical numerical approach for the seismic analysis of fluid-filled tanks. However, there are no verification and validation studies reported in the literature that demonstrate the ability of an acoustic FSI numerical model to predict responses important to structural and mechanical design for intense translational and rotational earthquake inputs. Herein, an acoustic FSI formulation is implemented in the open-source Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE), and is formally verified and validated using analytical solutions and code-to-code verification, and experimental data, respectively. The analytical solutions are for small amplitude, unidirectional seismic inputs. The code-to-code verification utilizes a previously verified and validated Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) numerical model in the commercial finite element code LS-DYNA. The validation studies utilize a comprehensive data set assembled from results of 3D earthquake-simulator tests of a fluid-filled vessel. The acoustic numerical model in MOOSE is verified and validated for hydrodynamic pressures and support reactions except for cases that involve significant convective response. For small amplitude inputs, numerically predicted wave heights match those of the analytical solutions. The numerical model is not verified and validated for wave height calculations under intense 3D seismic inputs. The run times for the acoustic FSI simulations in MOOSE are an order of magnitude, or more, shorter than for the corresponding ALE simulations in LS-DYNA. The utility of the MOOSE acoustic FSI implementation is demonstrated by seismic analysis of a building equipped with a fluid-filled, advanced nuclear reactor.},

The activity revolves around the coarse-mesh thermal-hydraulics code Pronghorn and its application to gas and salt cooled Pebble bed reactor (PBR). The main difference between gas and salt cooled PBR from a thermal-hydraulics perspective is the fluid. To address the difference in fluid behavior, two separate approaches are implemented in the MOOSE Navier Stokes module: 1) a Boussinesq approximation and 2) a fully compressible formulation. The developed finite volume method capabilities are used for improving pre-existing gas-cooled and salt-cooled pebble-bed reactor models. A steady-state, multiphysics gas-cooled pebble-bed reactor model is created that couples the equilibrium core depletion capability developed in previous work, and the finite volume method capability developed for this report. The salt-cooled pebble-bed reactor model is upgraded to use the incompressible finite volume method capability and then extended to three spatial dimensions. Finally, several verification-and-validation exercises performed with Pronghorn are documented using the verification-and-validation report of the MooseDoc system. The goal of this effort to document the verification-and-validation level of Pronghorn and improve stakeholder confidence in the results obtained with Pronghorn.},

For light-water reactors (LWRs), swelling of the fuel and the pressure it imposes on the clad when they come into contact causes permanent clad deformation. Accurately characterizing the fuel-cladding interaction, which involves multiple physics, is essential to accurately simulate the fuel/cladding system. Thermomechanical modeling of this problem using a variationally consistent enforcement (e.g., a mortar approach) has been shown to improve the quality of results and facilitate convergence. Here, we present a general multiphysics computational framework for solving nuclear fuel problems using a mortar approach in BISON, a nuclear fuel performance code. Analyses show that using the mortar approach, which enables variationally consistent constraint enforcement, improves the quality of results as compared to the more commonly used node-on-face enforcement for representative LWR nuclear fuel simulations.},

This approach augments the Monitoring and Inspection (M\&I) concept for fuel qualification by enabling computation of the change in critical safety parameters as a result of altered thermo-physical fuel properties. This work uses newly developed capabilities in the MOOSE framework to perform the requisite M\&S. The neutronics code Griffin, using its neutron diffusion solver, is coupled to the coarse-mesh, multi-dimensional, thermal-hydraulic capabilities of Pronghorn. The resulting new capability enables efficient transient multiphysics simulations of open-pool-type MSR concepts, including delayed neutron precursor advection and beyond design basis events. The proposed approach uses the coupled Griffin/Pronghorn models to perform a sensitivity analysis by perturbing the salt thermophysical properties and evaluating the resulting impact on key safety parameters during an unprotected loss-of-forced-flow accident. In light of the challenges associated with predicting the effect of reactor operations and burnup on bulk salt properties, this work demonstrates how Griffin/Pronghorn multiphysics simulations may be used to evaluate whether changes in salt properties could potentially lead to unsafe reactor configurations.},

The discharge does not appear to produce streamers or arcs, but instead remains as a steady-state glow located at the end of the inner coaxial power feed. Plasma impedance was determined by comparing the loaded and unloaded impedance of the coaxial source RF input; this termination impedance was combined with a simple high-frequency global model to estimate an electron density of approximately 1011 cm-3 at 400 W delivered power in air. Optical emission characterization of the source shows a monotonic increase in emission with respect with power; the relative intensity of the peaks from excited species, however, remains constant over a power range from 300 to 600 W. This unique source geometry presents a possible pathway for high gas throughput, large area, high power density processes such as surface modification, air purification, media removal and chemical surface treatment.},

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in the study of coupled plasma-liquid systems because of their applications to biomedicine, biological and chemical disinfection, agriculture, and other areas. Optimizing these applications requires a fundamental understanding of the coupling between phases. Though much progress has been made in this regard, there is still more to be done. One area that requires more research is the transport of electrons across the plasma-liquid interface. Some pioneering works (Rumbach et al 2015 Nat. Commun. 6, Rumbach et al 2015 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 48 424001) have begun revealing the near-surface liquid characteristics of electrons. However, there has been little work to determine the near-surface gas phase electron characteristics. Without an understanding of the near-surface gas dynamics, modellers are left to make assumptions about the interfacial conditions. For instance it is commonly assumed that the surface loss or sticking coefficient of gas-phase electrons at the interface is equal to 1. In this work we explore the consequences of this assumption and introduce a couple of ways to think about the electron interfacial condition. In one set of simulations we impose a kinetic condition with varying surface loss coefficient on the gas phase interfacial electrons. In a second set of simulations we introduce a Henry's law like condition at the interface in which the gas-phase electron concentration is assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the liquid-phase electron concentration. It is shown that for a range of electron Henry coefficients spanning a range of known hydrophilic specie Henry coefficients, the gas phase electron density in the anode can vary by orders of magnitude. Varying reflection of electrons by the interface also has consequences for the electron energy profile; increasing reflection may lead to increasing thermalization of electrons depending on choices about the electron energy boundary condition. This variation in anode electron density and energy as a function of the interface characteristics could also lead to significant variation in near-surface gas chemistries when such reactions are included in the model; this could very well in turn affect the reactive species impinging on the liquid surface. We draw the conclusion that in order to make more confident model predictions about plasma-liquid systems, finer scale simulations and/or new experimental techniques must be used to elucidate the near-surface gas phase electron dynamics.},

	abstract = {A large-volume atmospheric glow discharge has been used to incorporate nitrogen species into aqueous solution that is subsequently used to fertilize radishes, marigolds, and tomatoes. Treatment with plasma activated water (PAW) was compared to a tap water control. Water application began immediately after seeding and continued for 4~weeks. At the conclusion of the experiment, PAW treated plants had shoot masses 1.7{\textendash}2.2 times larger than controls. Subsequent research has focused on optimizing the amount of nitrogen in solution by varying discharge power, air flow, air{\textendash}water interface, and water alkalinity. When the discharge hovers over a stationary water phase, nitrate concentrations increase with decreasing power and increasing air flow. When water droplets are injected directly into the plasma, nitrate concentrations increase with increasing power and decreasing air flow. These contrasting trends are believed to depend on the balance between hydroxyl and electron concentrations in the discharge. Adding NaHCO3 to water before plasma treatment affects both the amount of nitrogen present in solution as well as the ratio between oxidized and reduced species. Concentrated NaHCO3 solution had 2.9 times more total nitrogen, 59 times more nitrite, and 27~\% less nitrate after plasma treatment than a solution with no NaHCO3. Two factors could contribute to the spike in nitrite and decrease in nitrate: reaction of nitric and nitrous oxides with bicarbonate to form nitrite, and a decrease in disproportionation of nitrate that occurs readily at acidic pH but negligibly under neutral conditions.},

This work models the momentum, heat, and neutral species mass transfer between gas and aqueous phases in the context of a streamer discharge; the qualitative conclusions are generally applicable to plasma-liquid systems. The problem domain is discretized using the finite element method. The most interesting and relevant model result for application purposes is the steep gradients in reactive species at the interface. At the center of where the reactive gas stream impinges on the water surface, the aqueous concentrations of OH and ONOOH decrease by roughly 9 and 4 orders of magnitude respectively within 50 m of the interface. Recognizing the limited penetration of reactive plasma species into the aqueous phase is critical to discussions about the therapeutic mechanisms for direct plasma treatment of biological solutions. Other interesting results from this study include the presence of a 10 K temperature drop in the gas boundary layer adjacent to the interface that arises from convective cooling. Though the temperature magnitudes may vary among atmospheric discharge types (different amounts of plasma-gas heating), this relative difference between gas and liquid bulk temperatures is expected to be present for any system in which convection is significant. Accounting for the resulting difference between gas and liquid bulk temperatures has a significant impact on reaction kinetics; factor of two changes in terminal aqueous species concentrations like H2O2, NO, and NO are observed in this study if the effect of evaporative cooling is not included.},

The delayed gamma contribution was obtained by using an additional calculation with the so-called PIKMT card. In addition, we demonstrate that the choice of nuclear data library has impact on the estimated heat deposited by replacing the nuclear data of all isotopes within the reactor with the ENDF/B-VIII.0, ENDF/B-VII.1 and the JENDL5.0 nuclear data libraries.},

Other models developed outside of NRIC were also ported to the VTB as part of this work, serving a broader mission to make computational reactor analysis models more widely available to the reactor community. The model development activities focused on demonstration of gas-cooled microreactor models including computational fluid dynamics simulations of flow through an industry-inspired air jacket design, and simulation of multiphysics transients for a gas-cooled microreactor assembly. Additionally, development of a molten salt reactor (led at Idaho National Laboratory) was supported through Argonne{\textquoteright}s expertise in multigroup cross sections generation. Models for these two reactor types were targeted due to their relevancy to NRIC{\textquoteright}s Demonstration of Microreactor Experiments (DOME) and Laboratory for Operation and Testing in the U.S. (LOTUS) physical test beds, which are slated to host microreactor and molten salt reactor experiments. The model porting activities consisted of developing detailed documentation for several physics models which originate from the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program.

Although the direct electricity end uses are straightforward, the feasibility of microreactors{\textquoteright} integration for thermal end use has not been analyzed in literature in sufficient detail. Delivering process heat generated by nuclear microreactors to supply the high temperatures essential for hydrogen production has been proposed as one cogeneration option that can further aid in the alleviation of climate change, since hydrogen can replace carbon-emitting fuels such as gasoline, diesel or natural gas. This review provides a novel perspective on the intersection of microreactors and process heat use by investigating hydrogen production technologies, microreactor designs and process heat integration options. A comprehensive overview of hydrogen production methods including electrolysis and thermochemical conversions of hydrocarbons and water is presented by classifying the methods based on process temperatures and maturity. Additionally, an in-depth summary detailing the reactor type, power output, and maximum operating temperature of many prospective microreactor designs has been created. Finally, heat transfer options for integrating microreactors to hydrogen production systems were evaluated. The intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) assessment considers IHX material, IHX type, and heat transfer media utilized within the apparatus.},

	abstract = {Liquid fueled molten salt reactor modeling can be challenging, as the fuel composition varies temporally and spatially. Although these models are challenging, they are important for predicting reactor safety and performance during operation. One of the reasons these models are challenging is the difficulty in capturing different physical phenomena which occur in different time scales. Over short time scales, one of these physical phenomena is the movement of delayed neutron precursors to less important regions of the reactor.
For longer time scales, one of these physical phenomena is online reprocessing, which includes adding fresh fuel and removing fission products from the reactor during operation and is the focus of this work. Reprocessing is useful in liquid fueled molten salt reactors because it limits chemical corrosion and improves the neutron economy. Reprocessing can be performed continuously during operation, referred to as online reprocessing, or in batches during outages, referred to as batchwise reprocessing. In order to simulate reprocessing computationally, there are two different mathematical approaches which are commonly implemented in the literature, called batchwise and continuous reprocessing. The continuous reprocessing method is more physically reflective of reactors using a chemically continuous reprocessing scheme. However, there are many works which have implemented batchwise reprocessing methods to simulate a physically continuous reprocessing process. In this thesis, I show that continuous reprocessing and batchwise reprocessing methods are not interchangeable. Using both methods on the same system shows that there are non-trivial differences in the results. I also investigate the computational cost of different reprocessing methods by performing a depletion time step refinement study. In this study, I found that continuous reprocessing allows for significantly larger time steps without large increases in error, which reduces computational cost. However, continuous reprocessing does not necessarily keep the overall mass constant, thus potentially leading to a nonphysical solution. I compare the differences between both methods while determining the effect of this nonphysical mass change caused by continuous reprocessing.},

Realistic in this sense entails two aspects: reactivity of the core, and oxidation potential of the fuel. The core reactivity should be maintained near zero as with any nuclear reactor. Gross reactivity control is provided by variations of the refuel rate of the reactor. Fine reactivity adjustments are expected to be done with control mechanisms in real-life power operation. The Python library developed allows a user to set bounds on the desired ke f f value. Fuel oxidation potential must be controlled for any liquid fueled reactor. As a simple example, consider this fission where the fuel becomes more oxidizing: UF\{sub 4\} {\textrightarrow} SrF\{sub 2\} + Xe + 2F\{sup -\} It can be shown using expected fission product oxidation state data that for these reactors, the fuel will become more oxidizing over time as a result of accumulation of excess fluoride ion. Addition of a reducing agent to reactor fuel will be necessary in the operation of molten salt reactors.},

This has lead to an interest in implementing nuclear energy

reactor [1]. As the reactor is located in space, there are a number of constraints that need to be placed upon the design of the
reactor. Specifically, the reactor needs to be both lightweight
and highly reliable over its entire operation lifetime.
To achieve low mass and lengthy operation, highly fissile
plutonium-239 based fuel operating in a semi-fast spectrum
was chosen. Such fuel, in addition to enabling low startup
critical mass, could be employed to partially fulfill the obligations made in the 2001 plutonium disposition and management agreement [2]. Because of this, a new low mass space
reactor concept has been developed to provide 20kW(t) over a
20 year long mission to the Martian surface. This reactor design is known as the Plutonium Ultra-Light Surface Reactor
or PULSR for short, generally illustrated by Figure 1.},

	abstract = {The serpentTools Python package is presented as a useful and efficient alternative for processing Serpent results. One positive attribute of Serpent is that many output files are exported directly in a MATLAB format, allowing for results to be loaded with minimal to no effort. However, some files for larger analyses may require immense amounts of memory to load and store all the data, leading to long wait times. To expedite the process of data handling and ease common analyses, the Computational Reactor Engineering lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology has released and is maintaining the serpentTools Python package: a set of data parsers and containers intended to streamline analysis with Serpent outputs. The parsers are capable of processing large outputs with ease, and yield all data to the user in a simple object-oriented framework. Data can be read into Python in comparable or better times than MATLAB, with the option to store only data needed for a specific purpose. Furthermore, common analyses are implemented directly into the package to expedite frequent analysis, including plotting meshed data and flux specta. serpentTools is designed to be a useful and practical manner by which the Serpent community can load and analyze data inside a Python environment. This paper presents the Python package, highlighting some basic features, and compares capabilities to similar platforms.},

	abstract = {The United States is considering the deployment of advanced reactors that require uranium enriched between 5-20\% 235U, often referred to as High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). At the present, there are no commercial facilities in the US to produce HALEU, prompting questions of how to create a dependable supply chain of HALEU to support these reactors. HALEU can be produced through two primary methods: downblending High Enriched Uranium (HEU) and enriching natural uranium. The amount of HEU available and impurities present in the HEU limit downblending capabilities. The Separative Work Unit (SWU) capacity and amount of natural uranium available limit enriching natural uranium capabilities. To understand the resources necessary to commercially produce HALEU with each of these methods, one can quantify the material requirements of transitioning to HALEU-fueled reactors. 

In this dissertation, we model the transition from Light Water Reactors to different advanced reactors, considering once-through and closed fuel cycles to determine material requirements for supporting these fuel cycles. Material requirements of interest across this work include the mass of enriched uranium, mass of HALEU, feed uranium, SWU capacity, and the mass of used fuel sent for disposal. We use CYCLUS and publicly-available information about Light Water Reactors, the X-energy Xe-100, the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor, and the NuScale VOYGR to model potential transition scenarios and demonstrate the methodologies developed in this work. To more accurately model the closed fuel cycles, we develop a new CYCLUS archetype, called OpenMCyclus, that couples with OpenMC to dynamically model fuel depletion in a reactor and provide more accurate used fuel compositions. The results of this transition analysis show how the characteristics of the advanced reactors deployed drive the materials required to support the fuel cycle. Closing the fuel cycle reduces the materials required, but the reduction in materials is driven by the amount of material available for reprocessing. 

To gain more insight into how transition parameters not considered in the transition analysis affect material requirements, we perform sensitivity analysis on one of the once-through transitions by coupling CYCLUS with Dakota. The results of the sensitivity analysis highlight some of the trade-offs between different reactor designs. One such tradeoff is the increased HALEU demand but decreased used fuel discharged when increasing the Xe-100 deployment and decreasing the VOYGR deployment. Additionally, these results identify the Xe-100 discharge burnup as consistently being one of the most impactful input parameters for this transition, because of how the deployment scheme in this work affects the number of Xe-100s built no matter which advanced reactor build share is specified.

To identify potential transitions that minimize material requirements, we then use the CYCLUS-Dakota to optimize a once-through transition using the genetic algorithms in Dakota. In single-objective problems to minimize the SWU capacity required to produce HALEU and minimize the amount of used nuclear fuel, the algorithm finds solutions that are consistent with the results of the sensitivity analysis. The results cannot be taken at face value, because the algorithm did not fully converge and the genetic algorithms do not enforce the applied linear constraint for the advanced reactor build shares to sum to 100\%. However, the results provide guidance on how to adjust the input parameters to optimize the transition for a minimal HALEU SWU or the used fuel mass. Parameter adjustments include maximizing the number of Light Water Reactors that receive license extensions to operate for 80 years. Similar results occur when using this method for a multi-objective problem to minimize both the HALEU SWU capacity and the used fuel mass. 

Finally, we use neutronics models of the Xe-100 and Micro Modular Reactor reactor designs to evaluate the steady-state reactor physics performance of downblended HEU in these two designs. We compare the performance of the downblended HEU to nominally enriched fuel, based on the k-eff, $\beta$eff, energy- and spatially-dependent neutron fluxes, as well as the fuel, moderator, coolant, and total reactivity temperature feedback coefficients. The differences in the fuel compositions leads to differences in each of the metrics. However, these differences are within error of the results of the nominally enriched fuel, or would not prevent the reactor from meeting stated design specifications or operating in a safe state.

The work completed in this dissertation develops and demonstrates a methodology for modeling fuel cycle transitions and understanding the effects of deploying HALEU-fueled reactors in the US. The effects investigated in these example scenarios include various materials and resources required to support these reactors, and how the parameters of the transition affect these requirements. The information generated from this new methodology can be used to develop the necessary infrastructure and supply chains for support a transition to HALEU-fueled reactors. Furthermore, this work explores how the HALEU production method (enriching compared with downblending) affects reactor performance.},

	abstract = {The 40Ar/39Ar radiometric dating technique is an attractive option for future extraterrestrial geochronology applications. However, in situ 40Ar/39Ar radiometric dating on Mars presents unique challenges to the design of a device capable of achieving sufficient precision on geological samples obtained on the Martian surface. For this application, a fast neutron source with a low thermal neutron flux is ideal for inducing the 39K(n,p)39Ar reaction with few competing reactions that require age-correction factors. This paper explores the design of a neutron emitting device specifically for in situ geochronological applications on extraterrestrial surfaces. We have determined that a feasible design is likely to include a 252Cf spontaneous fission source shielded by polyethylene layered with a strong thermal neutron absorber. Although boosting options-induced fission sources, ($\alpha$,n)-are available, they do not provide sufficient neutron multiplicity to justify the increased mass of the device. Furthermore, shielding the rover from the neutron source will likely comprise the largest fractional mass of the device, which will be reduced by shielding only a small solid angle of the source. While we have determined that it is possible to design such a neutron source, there will also be other instrumentation competing for a mass fraction of the Rover instrument payload. This may make it difficult to design a device that achieves the required mass and fluence limitations for a future mission. However, this work provides a realistic path forward in determining a future workable design. Copyright {\textcopyright} (2015) by the American Nuclear Society All rights reserved.},

This method generates an alternate form of the adjoint scalar flux quantity, $\varphi${\textdagger}$\Omega$ which is used by both CADIS and FW-CADIS to generate variance reduction parameters for local and global response functions, respectively. The new method, called CADIS-$\Omega$, was implemented in the Denovo/ADVANTG software suite, and results are presented for a concrete labyrinth test problem. Results indicate that the flux generated by CADIS-$\Omega$ incorporates localized angular anisotropics in the flux effectively. CADIS-$\Omega$ outperformed CADIS in the test problem while obtaining correct results. This initial work indicates that CADIS-$\Omega$ may be highly useful for shielding problems with strong angular anisotropics. A future test plan to fully characterize the new method is proposed, which should reveal more about the types of realistic problems for which the CADIS-$\Omega$ will be suited.},

Although various chronological methods for in situ geochronology have been proposed (e.g., Rb-Sr, K-Ar), and even applied (K-Ar), the reliability, accuracy, and applicability of the 40Ar/39Ar method makes it by far the most desirable chronometer for dating extra-terrestrial bodies. The method however relies on the neutron irradiation of samples, and thus a neutron source. Herein, we discuss the challenges and feasibility of deploying a passive neutron source to planetary surfaces for the in situ application of the 40Ar/39Ar chronometer. Requirements in generating and shielding neutrons, as well as analysing samples are described, along with an exploration of limitations such as mass, power and cost. Two potential solutions for the in situ extra-terrestrial deployment of the 40Ar/39Ar method are presented. Although this represents a challenging task, developing the technology to apply the 40Ar/39Ar method on planetary surfaces would represent a major advance towards constraining the timescale of solar system formation and evolution.},

As part of a wider effort to bring yt to the geosciences, we present an initial use-case of yt applied to 3D seismic tomography models of the upper mantle from the IRIS Earth Model Collaboration. While the rendering capabilities of yt can in general be applied directly to 3D geoscience data, we add several graphical elements to the 3D rendering to aid in interpretation of volume renderings including latitude/longitude overlays and shapefile suport for plotting political and tectonic boundaries along the Earth{\textquoteright}s surface. In this notebook, we focus on tomographic models of North America and the Western U.S., where high resolution models and rapidly varying seismic properties provide a rich dataset to explore systematically at a range of lengthscales. The notebook demonstrates loading and rendering of IRIS netcdf models, highlighting interesting 3D features of the Western U.S. upper mantle, and goes on to demonstrate how having direct control of the transfer functions used in creating the final volume rendering allows for a more systematic exploration of the role of the visualization method in our interpretation of 3D volumetric data. Finally, we conclude by demonstrating some of the semantically-aware capabilities of yt for analysis purposes, and demonstrate how these tools have cross-disciplinary functionality.},

	abstract = {LINDSAY, ALEXANDER DAVID. Coupling of Plasmas and Liquids. (Under the direction of
Steven Shannon.)
Plasma-liquids have exciting applications to several important socioeconomic areas, including
agriculture, water treatment, and medicine. To realize their application potential, the basic
physical and chemical phenomena of plasma-liquid systems must be better understood. Additionally, system designs must be optimized in order to maximize fluxes of critical plasma species
to the liquid phase. With objectives to increase understanding of these systems and optimize
their applications, we have performed both comprehensive modelling and experimental work. To
date, models of plasma-liquids have focused on configurations where diffusion is the dominant
transport process in both gas and liquid phases. However, convection plays a key role in many
popular plasma source designs, including jets, corona discharges, and torches. In this dissertation,
we model momentum, heat, and neutral species mass transfer in a convection-dominated system
based on a corona discharge. We show that evaporative cooling produced by gas-phase convection
can lead to a significant difference between gas and liquid phase bulk temperatures. Additionally,
convection induced in the liquid phase by the gas phase flow substantially increases interfacial
mass transfer of hydrophobic species like NO and NO2. Finally, liquid kinetic modelling suggests that concentrations of highly reactive species like OH and ONOOH are several orders of
magnitude higher at the interface than in the solution bulk.
Subsequent modelling has focused on coupling discharge physics with species transport at and
through the interface. An assumption commonly seen in the literature is that interfacial loss
coefficients of charged species like electrons are equal to unity. However, there is no experimental
evidence to either deny or support this assumption. Without knowing the true interfacial behavior
of electrons, we have explored the effects on key plasma-liquid variables of varying interfacial
parameters like the electron and energy surface loss coefficients. Within a reasonable range for
these parameters, we have demonstrated that the electron density on the gas phase side of the
interface can vary by orders of magnitude. Significant effects can also be seen on the gas phase
interfacial electron energy. Electron density and energy will play important roles in determining
gas phase chemistry in more complex future models; this will in turn feed back into the liquid
phase chemistry. To remove this uncertainty in interfacial behavior, we recommend finer scale
atomistic or molecular dynamics simulations. Efficient coupling of the highly non-linear discharge
physics equations to liquid transport required creation of a new simulation code named Zapdos,
built on top of the MOOSE framework. The operation and capabilities of the code are described
in this work. Moreover, changes made to the MOOSE framework allowing coupling of physics
across subdomain boundaries, necessary for plasma-liquid coupling, are also detailed.
In the latter half of this work, we investigate experimental optimization and characterization of
plasma-liquid interactions surrounding a unique very high frequency (VHF) plasma discharge.
Several geometric configurations are considered. In the most promising set-up, the discharge
is pointed upwards and water is pumped through the source{\textquoteright}s inner conductor until it forms
a milimeter thick water layer on top of the powered electrode. This maximizes the amount of
charged and neutral species flux received by the aqueous phase as well as the amount of water
vapor created in the gas phase. Additionally, the configuration eliminates electrode damage by
providing an infinitely renewable liquid surface layer. The presence of large amounts of water
vapor and OH radicals is confirmed by optical emission and broadband absorption spectroscopy.
Characterization of liquid phase species like NO-
3
, NO-
2
, and H2O2 is carried out through ion
chromatography (IC) and colorimetric measurements.
After detailing the design and characterization of our plasma-liquid systems, we illustrate their
applications to plant fertilization and wastewater disinfection. In a four-week collaborative experiment with the NCSU greenhouse, plants that received plasma-treated water grew significantly
larger than plants that received tap water. This is directly attributable to the approximately
hundred mg/L of NO-
3 dissolved into solution by the plasma. The VHF source also proved
effective at removing several aqueous contaminants designated harmful to humans by the EPA.
Air plasma treatment of solutions contaminated with 1,4-dioxane showed log reduction times
competitive with other advanced oxidative processes (AOP). Argon treatment of dixoane was an
order of magnitude more effective in terms of log reduction time, although the associated costs
are significantly higher. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) proved resistant to several VHF
design iterations. However, the water electrode design introduced in the passage above achieved a
log reduction in low level PFOS concentrations over the course of twenty five minutes, suggesting
that it may be viable as an advanced technology for degradation of persistent perfluorinated
compounds.
Future work will serve to further unify the modelling and experimental work presented here.
Three dimensional models are being actively developed to explore the spreading of discharges
over water as a function of the water conductivity. Electromagnetic models are also being
introduced into Zapdos that will enable simulation of the VHF source in contact with liquids.
Completion of those models will be followed by simulations attempting to reproduce the gaseous
OH density and liquid phase NO-
x and H2O2 concentration measurements.},

	abstract = {In last year{\textquoteright}s Bison robustness report, the authors demonstrated that improving the Jacobian matrix can drastically increase solution convergence rates. The development of an automatic differentiation (AD) capability in the MOOSE framework has created the possibility of having exact Jacobian matrices for all of our material models. A large focus in this year{\textquoteright}s report is the application of AD to MOOSE physics modules, such as the tensor mechanics module, and the application to Bison fuel and cladding material models. A second main focus in this year{\textquoteright}s report is the investigation of a set of algorithmic solver changes to improve the robustness and performance of Bison LWR simulations. Beyond providing increased solver robustness, the ability to solve strongly coupled multiphysics problems, and solving large deformation problems with ease, these automatically generated perfect Jacobians also drastically reduce development time for new models. In models converted to AD, Jacobian computation made up the majority of the code base. With this code removed, both readability and maintainability of the MOOSE/Bison code base are improved. The work documented here significantly improved the robustness of the Bison LWR assessment case suite. Through algorithmic changes in solver infrastructure, such as the application of predictors and improvements in timestepping, tangible improvements in performance were observed. These improvements are documented using a new standard set of metrics that are collected in all assessment cases, and a suite of statistical analysis tools developed for this report.},

A test problem mimicking the conditions achieved in a depressurized loss of forced cooling (DLOFC) event was solved with both RELAP-5 and Pronghorn. Pronghorn employed a finite vol ume method with the Kurganov-Tadmor discretization. The comparison between the mass fraction spatial profiles computed with RELAP-5 and Pronghorn clearly shows the presence of numerical artifacts (i.e., overly diffusive behavior at low Mach numbers). We confirmed that the problem disappears at higher Mach numbers. We recommend future work on the implementation of a low Mach finite volume formulation to better treat low Mach number problems. Deliverable 2a: we demonstrated two approaches to model the radiation/conduction/natural convection heat transfer across a stagnant gas for the PBMR-400 design using Pronghorn. The first approach is based on the net radiation method, which relies on the computation of view factors with the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) ray tracing capability. The second method is a traditional thermal resistance approach. The test problems include both 2D and 3D geometries. In all cases, the results show very good agreement during a DLOFC transient. This confirms that the faster thermal resistance method produces solutions that are equivalent to the net radiation method for this geometry. Deliverable 3d: we demonstrated the use of the advection kernel for the delayed neutron precursor equation in Griffin with a 2D MSFR model. The results appear physical but further verification is recommended. We also recommend the addition of conjugate heat transfer to compute the temperatures and model the thermomechanic behavior of the reflectors and other structures. Significant memory and performance issues were encountered in the 3D axisymmetric model. Future work is recommended in this area. Task 8g: this task allows multidimensional MOOSE applications to be coupled to system codes (RELAP-7 and SAM). We implemented a faster multiphysics iteration coupling algorithm, which provides an overall 6{\texttimes} acceleration of the 3D-1D coupling of the core multidi- mensional fluid flow solver and the 1D primary and secondary loop model.},

This talk will describe the development and initial validation of a MOOSE-based EM solver application, ELK (Electromagnetics Library for Kinetics and fluids), that utilizes the recently added vector-valued finite element system. The primary motivation for the development of ELK was to study EM wave propagation in radio-frequency (rf) driven systems, such as those encountered in the study of antenna structures, waveguides, and plasma physics. In simulating these scenarios with traditional scalar-valued finite elements, boundary conditions on tangential field components can sometimes be difficult to define, and field discontinuities encountered with certain geometric or structural features (e.g., abrupt corners and inhomogeneous materials) can often lead to non-physical results. Vector-valued elements can largely mitigate and even eliminate these difficulties. ELK verification and validation efforts thus far have focused on standard wave propagation benchmarks for antennas and waveguides, and the impact of vector-valued elements on the implementation and results of these simulations will be described. Progress using ELK for plasma physics simulation, where inhomogeneous simulation domains are commonplace, will also be discussed.},

In previous work, Pronghorn has effectively modeled low-to-medium speed flows in scenarios such as the one described in the two-dimensional PBMR-400 benchmark, using its finite-element-based streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilized implementation of the Euler equations. However, limitations of this method become apparent when dealing with more complicated geometries (e.g. imposing slip boundary conditions at nodes belonging to two different boundaries) and when gas speeds are fast enough for shocks and supersonic flow to occur. For these problems, the finite-element-based solver lacks robustness and is plagued by slow iterative convergence or even divergence. In order to address these challenges, the Pronghorn code at INL has been updated with new, modified versions of its original equations. The new Pronghorn models are built on the finite volume method with a Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact (HLLC) Riemann solver based numerical flux method, which (1) allows imposing slip boundary conditions much more robustly and (2) performs well for a wide range of flow speeds. The finite-volume-based flow solver will form the basis for a robust coarse-mesh thermal-hydraulics capability in Pronghorn.},

	abstract = {Solving finite element problems with friction often increases the level of difficulty to obtain properly converged solutions. This type of challenge becomes more salient when advanced, possibly multiscale, material models are employed to capture the thermomechanical behavior of fuel and cladding materials. The present work details our recent developments in a nuclear fuel performance finite element code for the systematic consideration of friction in nuclear reactor finite element simulations. We show the application of friction and its effects on the mechanics of light-water reactor rods accounting for various fuel constitutive modeling techniques, model dimensionalities, pellet assumed geometries, and power conditions. In particular, we focus on the fuel rod mechanical behavior as it relates to fuel constitutive models, sensitivity to the coefficient of friction, pellet states of stress, and rod elongation. We discuss the trade-offs between the various multidimensional modeling options and highlight the relevance of frictional effects in the prediction of the fuel rod deformation and interfacial stresses. To relate our modeling results with actual reactor operation, simulations including frictional effects are compared with fuel rod elongation experimental data and some challenges for carrying out a full validation of the axial mechanics are discussed.},

	url = {https://www.ans.org/pubs/proceedings/article-54158/},
	abstract = {Nuclear power is a significant source of electricity in the United States, but the average U.S. nuclear power plant is
around 40 years old. Safe management of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is a crucial aspect of the back end of the nuclear
fuel cycle. SNF dry storage systems are increasingly popular as they represent an effective solution in this area, given
the absence of a final disposal system. In particular, the spent fuel cask system (dry cask method) provides a feasible
solution for maintaining SNF (\~{}60 years) prior to the final disposal.
The HI-STORM overpack and MPC-32 canister are the primary components of the HI-STORM 100 dry cask storage system. They remove heat from the system via natural circulation with no human intervention required. This
characteristic provides passive heat removal while requiring little maintenance in dry cask storage systems.
This project aims to validate and compare the capabilities of a thermal model of HI-STORM overpack developed using
the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) based on the author{\textquoteright}s previous study. MOOSE
is an open-source framework developed by Idaho National Laboratory for multiscale, multiphysics simulations. This
study will improve the capabilities of the thermal-hydraulic model of the HI-STORM dry cask storage system by producing high-fidelity results for the air circulation in the overpack. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are performed using
the open-source spectral element code NekRS, developed by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), for simulating
transitional and turbulent flows in complex geometries. NekRS will produce high-fidelity results for the HI-STORM
overpack to assess the validity of the current thermal-hydraulic model.
This work aims to improve the modeling of the HI-STORM overpack system that was previously developed and
validated. The objective of obtaining high-fidelity results is to gain a deeper understanding of the turbulence characteristics of air circulation in the HI-STORM overpack systems, which will then be used to validate the assumptions
of lower-fidelity models. Finally, the results produced by NekRS will be compared with those of the current MOOSE
model to evaluate the performance of both models.},

We leverage a recently developed computational framework for modeling thermomechanical contact in dynamic simulations from the nuclear fuel performance code Bison. Usage of mortar contact ensures a smooth distribution of normal and frictional contact forces, displacements, and velocities on the contact interface, thus facilitating an accurate computation of wear. The integration within an advanced nuclear fuel performance code enables analysis of complex interactions between the fuel, cladding, and spacer grid. Such interactions include swelling, creep, fuel fragmentation, burnup, plenum pressure, and fission gas release. Our methodology is demonstrated via the modeling of two spacer grid geometries and the influence of fuel-cladding mechanical contact on the generation of fretting wear.},

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1988114},
	abstract = {Usage of contact mechanics methodologies is a pervasive modeling requirement in dynamic simulations. While for some trivial problems, solutions taken from analytical geometry are available, use of a finite element framework is common to achieve formulation generality. This work explores two dynamic contact formulations: one based on the traditional node-to-segment (NTS) approach, and a variationally consistent segment-to-segment (STS) mortar formulation. The NTS formulation employed here enforces the constraints kinematically (i.e., the interpenetration is enforced to the solver tolerance), whereas the mortar approach uses Lagrange multipliers to enforce the contact constraints. Both approaches are implemented in the open-source finite element framework Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). The results highlight two relevant contact-interface-related dynamic phenomena in finite element simulations. First, stabilization of contact constraints is discussed, taking into account the evolution of the total energy in a benchmark problem. Second, the influence of finite element discretization on both of the aforementioned contact formulations is analyzed by exercising a large-deformation example with continuous relative sliding. Variationally consistent contact approaches such as the mortar formulation lead to improved energy preservation and avoid spurious excitation of the system's frequencies. This is especially relevant in settings where inertia and vibrations are of importance.},

The spent fuel cask system (dry cask method) provides a feasible solution to maintain spent fuel for 60 years before final disposal. Dry cask storage has many characteristics that make it attractive.

The HI-STORM overpack and MPC-32 canister are the main parts of the HI-STORM 100 dry cask storage system. These components remove heat from the system using natural circulation, requiring no human intervention. This is the characteristic that provides passive heat removal and low maintenance features in dry cask storage systems. To develop a thermal model for a dry cask storage system, the physics behind the system should be defined clearly. There are two natural circulation loops in the system; circulation of helium cools down the nuclear assemblies in the MPC, while circulation of air cools down the walls of the MPC.

The new scalar transport module (STM) will likely also draw on the component syntax of THM to make input files more readable for users. It may also use the electromagnetics module to compute ionic species transport in electromagnetic fields. It will be helpful for any groups that need to calculate scalar transport, such as precursor transport in molten salt reactors and ion and neutral transport in (fusion) plasmas.},

This plug- and-play paradigm allows rapid development of multiphysics modeling capabilities for a diverse set of problems by non-expert users. New features include the ability for MOOSE to transfer data between {\textquotedblleft}sibling{\textquotedblright} applications, rather than just between parent and child, and new syntax to facilitate data transfer between codes using different coordinate systems. The VTB hosts numerous nuclear reactor multiphysics examples using the MOOSE capabilities described here.

This coupling can allow for improvement of multiphysics simulations where one set of physics is best suited for an FE discretization, while another set is best suited for an FV discretization. Plasma dynamics is a fitting example where the electromagnetic field equations are solved with FE and the fluid flow is solved with FV. The new FE to FV coupling method can be summarized as taking the element or face average of the FE variable value or gradient and applying that quantity directly in the FV equation objects. Verification and validation (V\&V) were conducted based on Zapdos FE-only V\&V efforts. Verification included method of manufactured solutions (MMS) with spatial and temporal convergence studies. These MMS studies were modularized, such that simple decoupled physics to fully coupled multi-fluid problems were studied. Validation included benchmarking with FE-only simulations to investigate the benefits of FE-FV coupling over the traditional FE-only simulations. Initial V\&V studies show good alignment to theory and previous simulation.

Validation and verification studies were done within three broad studies. First, temporal and spatial convergence studies were conducted by using the method of manufactured solutions (MMS), where different coupling configurations were tested. Second, Zapdos results were compared to previous simulations for a push-pull RF discharge of argon in the GEC reference cell for 1 Torr in 1D, and 1 Torr and 100 mTorr in 2D. Finally, a parametric study was done for argon at varying pressure and voltage for RF discharges at 13.56 MHz in a GEC reference cell and compared to previous experimental results for electron and metastable densities that used microwave interferometry and laser-induced fluorescence, respectively. The MMS study results resembled the expected theoretically convergence trends with electron mean energy being particular sensitive. The comparisons to previous simulations matched within reason. Current experiment validation results follow previous experimental trend, with some deviation for pressure near 100 mTorr. A possible reason for those deviations could be due to the current assumptions within Zapdos based on the fluid approximation of plasmas.},

Within the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) open-source framework [1], capabilities have been demonstrated in the areas of plasma fluids (Zapdos [2]), plasma chemistry (CRANE [3]), and general electromagnetic wave theory (Electromagnetic Library for Kinetics \& fluids [ELK] [4]).

This talk will detail the continued validation efforts and discuss Zapdos-ELK-CRANE code coupling with various-low temperature plasma sources.

Surface boundaries, species temperatures, and field solutions were investigated during the validation efforts. Studied phenomena included DC self-biasing on the surfaces of RF powered electrodes and gas heating effects on the background gas and ions. To reduce the simulation wall time for the large number of RF cycles needed to reach a periodic steady state, an accelerator based on a modified shooting method was added to Zapdos.

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Coupled plasma-liquid systems are at the heart of several burgeoning applications in low-temperature plasma science, including biomedicine, biological and chemical disinfection, agriculture, and others. In order to realize the full potential of these applications, the basic underlying physical and chemical phenomena must be understood. Recent modeling [1] and experimental [2] work have done much to elucidate system behavior but more questions remain, particularly in the interfacial region. The surface loss probability of gas phase electrons striking the interface, a critical parameter for many plasma simulations, is unknown; to date authors have generally assumed a value of unity, however there is no experimental evidence to either support or discourage this choice. The modeling work presented here explores the effects of varying key interfacial parameters. Two alternative interfacial models for electrons are considered: a kinetic one employing a surface loss probability, and a thermodynamic one in which the gas phase electron density is assumed to be in equilibrium with the liquid phase electron density with a ratio specified by a Henry's Law like coefficient (H). It is shown that if H is decreased from 106 ( H for hydrogen peroxide) to 102 ( H for hydroxyl radical), the gas phase electron density at the interface increases by three orders of magnitude. Moreover, if reflected electrons are still assumed to deposit their energy at the interface through collisions like vibrational excitation of surface molecules, then increasing reflection not only increases the density of gas phase electrons, but it also decreases the average energy of the electrons in the interfacial region. This could have significant impacts on both gas and liquid chemistry, e.g. the presence of a large number of colder electrons could lead to a large amount of electron attachment and production of negative ions in the near-interface region. The variability of key plasma variables like electron density and electron energy with respect to assumptions about the interface should motivate molecular scale simulations and/or new experimental diagnostics capable of probing the plasma in the near interface region.},

	abstract = {Hyrdoxyl radicals are a well-known oxidizing agent that has many uses in the removal of contaminants from materials in both liquid and gas phases. To this end, an atmospheric plasma, operated at 162MHz, is used for the production of dissociated reactive species through plasma enhanced vaporization, ionization and the functionalization of liquid precursors via non-thermal plasma treatment. A coaxial source is used that has all components DC grounded allowing for the flow of water through the device creating a layer of water on the surface of the powered electrode. The plasma can be completely sustained through the evaporation of water from the electrode without the need for noble gases or any other feedgas. Air can also be flown through the device with little effect on OH densities but can be used to change the shape of the discharge at the exit of the device, which could be desirable for different applications. The emission spectrum of the discharge is completely dominated by the emissions of the hydroxyl radical. Spatially resolved absorption spectroscopy is performed using a broadband white light source that only requires a single pass through the plasma. OH concentrations have been calculated to be 1014-1016 cm-3.},

The deviation of OH rotational states from equilibrium under high humidity conditions is also presented. In contradiction with findings of other groups, high energy rotational states appear to become underpopulated with increasing humidity. In the aqueous phase, concentrations of longer-lived species such as nitrate, nitrite, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone are determined using ion chromatography and colorimetric methods. Spin-traps and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) are investigated for characterization of short-lived aqueous radicals like OH, O2-, NO, and ONOO-.

	shorttitle = {Seismic fluid-structure interaction in tanks using an acoustic formulation},
	abstract = {Due to its computational efficiency and an ability to model complex geometries, an acoustic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) formulation is an attractive numerical approach for modeling fluid-filled tanks. However, few large-scale verification and validation (V\&V) studies exist that use acoustic FSI for seismic analysis while considering multiple response quantities and multi-directional seismic inputs. We present such a V\&V study performed using the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). We first verify the acoustic FSI formulation using simple benchmark problems for which exact analytical solutions are available. Next, we verify acoustic FSI for a head-supported cylindrical tank partially filled with water and subjected to uni-directional shaking by comparing with analytical solutions, with which, the acoustic FSI results match closely. We validate acoustic FSI by comparing the simulation results with experimental data considering multi-directional seismic shaking of a base-supported cylindrical tank partially filled with water and subjected to peak ground accelerations of 0.1-1g. The acoustic FSI implementation in MOOSE satisfactorily predicts peak pressures and support moments recorded during the experiments. The comparisons also show that it might be challenging to predict the wave height at the fluid surface, given the complex surface wave responses, especially at more intense shaking. A comparison of simulation times showed that acoustic FSI is at least an order of magnitude faster than the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian and incompressible computational fluid dynamics numerical methods. To demonstrate MOOSE's capabilities for handling large multiphysics numerical models , seismic FSI analysis is performed on a full-scale nuclear power plant building that houses a molten-salt reactor vessel.},

	abstract = {Nuclear research reactors enable a wide range of applications and support the development of multiple fields, including energy production, isotope production, space discovery, among others. Research reactor safety analyses demonstrate the contribution of the operational procedures to the prevention of accidents, focusing mainly on the reactor core. These analyses rely on the assumption of heat being locally deposited in the core after shutdown. This work, however, is concerned with research reactor experiments, and it investigates more detailed methods targeting the specific reactor regions hosting the experiments.

Additionally, research reactor experiments require the development of individual experiment safety analyses, which due to the lack of a streamlined workflow becomes effort and time-consuming as well as error-prone. This thesis supports the development of safety analyses for research reactor experiments with the objective of streamlining the calculation procedure as well as accelerating it. The methodology presented here calculates the delayed heating in experiments, generates the volumetric heat source term for thermal-fluids calculations, solves the experiment temperature evolution during a channel draining event, and determines if the event leads to a radioactive material release. Moreover, this work examines methods to accelerate the calculation, which include the creation of a generic material irradiation database and data-based modeling.

This thesis starts with a literature survey summarizing previous work relevant to delayed heating calculations, transport/depletion solvers, and machine learning applied to nuclear engineering. The conclusions of the survey guide the choice of methods for the delayed heating calculation and the choice of machine learning algorithms for the data-based modeling.

The following chapters focus on the calculation workflows. This thesis establishes a delayed heating calculation workflow based on the formal three-step method that builds on top of the MCNP-ORIGEN Activation Automation (MOAA) tool. This workflow is demonstrated and verified with several exercises, which also ease the workflow visualization. The workflow is also demonstrated in two full-size research reactors, for which the heat in the structures and an experiment are calculated.

A simple modification of the delayed heating calculation workflow generates a shutdown dose rate calculation workflow as a value-added. This calculation workflow helps guide the post-irradiation examination (PIE) of experiments and helps prevent the unnecessary exposure of personnel and surrounding equipment. The calculation workflow is demonstrated for a Tristructural Isotropic (TRISO)-fueled experiment which highlights the applicability of this workflow to more complex geometries, such as High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGRs).

When focusing on the acceleration of the calculations, this thesis proposes the generic material irradiation database method. This method relies on the delayed heating calculation workflow to obtain the heat produced in experiments of individual chemical elements and through their combination calculate the heat produced in experiments of arbitrary material composition. This thesis verifies this method by studying a vast range of materials that could be used in a research reactor experiment.

Moreover, this thesis investigates the applicability of data-based modeling to predict the outcome of the most thermally challenging accident in an experiment, a channel draining event. The data preparation process and several machine learning algorithms are described before studying a simplified model. Several useful conclusions are drawn with the simplified model before scaling it up, with some minor modifications, to a full-size reactor experiment.

Finally, this thesis wraps up with the conclusions from all the previous calculations. Overall, the results presented in this thesis meet this thesis{\textquoteright} objectives and prove that the proposed methodology decreases the computational expense and enables quick calculations supporting research reactor experiments.},

	abstract = {Background
High-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) have many distinct features from the current light water reactor (LWR) fleet, and potential decommissioning strategies should take them into consideration. The proper characterization of the shutdown dose rates can establish a suitable strategy.

Methods
This article introduces a new shutdown dose rate calculation capability that relies on the MCNP-ORIGEN activation automation tool and the MCNP repeated structures to explicitly model the TRistructural ISOtropic (TRISO) particles as decay radiation sources.

Results
Three exercises are conducted with this capability, and their results discussed. The first two exercises verify and demonstrate the workflow. The third exercise proposes a decommissioning strategy for a high-temperature gas-cooled microreactor and studies its feasibility from the shutdown dose rate standpoint. The calculations yield a dose rate map above at the reactor citadel after a three month cool-down, showing values above 40 mSv/h.

Conclusions
The findings imply that the decommissioning strategy based on placing the reactor in a safe shutdown state and allowing it to cool down for three months before removing various components and extracting the fuel assemblies, may not be sufficient to minimize unnecessary exposure of personnel.},
