	abstract = {There is growing appreciation of the role that clean, reliable, always-on nuclear energy must play in America’s clean energy future. Large light water reactors are being constructed around the world and two units are approaching operation in Georgia. Much of the new reactor focus in the U.S., however, is on new, innovative reactor technologies. Private companies working in cooperation with the Department of Energy and supported by our national laboratories and universities are developing small modular reactor and advanced non-light water reactor designs. The reactor is not the end of the story, however. Each reactor requires a reliable supply of high-quality nuclear fuel to sustain the outstanding plant performance we have come to take for granted from the nuclear industry. Many of the reactor designs use high assay low enriched uranium or HALEU – a class of fissile material that is not currently used in power reactors and for which the supply chain is still developing. Making sure the fuel is available when the reactors are ready to start up is an essential piece of the new reactor puzzle. Knowledgeable and influential speakers in the opening plenary will explore the key issues associated with the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle.

Dr. Kathryn Huff is the acting Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy. Her office is instrumental in the deployment of new reactors as well as fuel cycle research and development.
Dr. Monica Regalbuto is the lead for Idaho National Laboratory’s Fuel Cycle Strategy and is responsible for ensuring an adequate supply of advanced reactor fuel.
Mr. John Kotek is the Nuclear Energy Institute’s Senior Vice President of Policy Development and Public Affairs and works to ensure that policies meet the needs of reactor developers and plant operators.},

Through rigorous multivariate statistical evaluation of cultural groupings, income and education on energy system preferences and lived experience, we identified cultural groups that experience energy affordability differently, irrespective of income or educational achievement. For energy policy issue and factor importance, we identify a positive link with educational achievement and income, varying across cultural grouping. Overall, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders and American Indian and Native Alaskans had a muted response to energy policy issues and energy system factors compared to their peers. Our findings identified a need to enhance overall educational outcomes to engender more positive attitudes toward improving the environment, and the need for policy makers to be aware of cultural group preferences to enable development of energy policies which improve recognition justice outcomes.},

	abstract = {Science gateways are a crucial component of critical infrastructure as they provide the means for users to focus on their topics and methods instead of the technical details of the infrastructure. They are defined as end-to-end solutions for accessing data, software, computing services, sensors, and equipment specific to the needs of a science or engineering discipline and their goal is to hide the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. Science gateways are often called Virtual Research Environments in Europe and Virtual Labs in Australasia; we consider these two terms to be synonymous with science gateways. Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have found applications in many different fields in private industry, and private industry has reaped the benefits. Likewise, in the academic realm, large-scale data science applications have also learned to apply public high-performance computing resources to make use of this technology. However, academic and research science gateways have yet to fully adopt the tools of AI. There is an opportunity in the gateways space, both to increase the visibility and accessibility to AI/ML applications and to enable researchers and developers to advance the field of science gateway cyberinfrastructure itself. Harnessing AI/ML is recognized as a high priority by the science gateway community. It is, therefore, critical for the next generation of science gateways to adapt to support the AI/ML that is already transforming many scientific fields. The goal is to increase collaborations between the two fields and to ensure that gateway services are used and are valuable to the AI/ML community. This chapter presents state-of-the-art examples and areas of opportunity for the science gateways community to pursue in relation to AI/ML and some vision of where these new capabilities might impact science gateways and support scientific research.},

	abstract = {Fuel cycle simulator development started many years ago by several research and engineering institutions or consulting firms for a wide range of applications. To improve confidence in the results, institutions may be tempted to increase the complexity of their software even if this complexity might not be necessary. On the other hand, some simulators may be used outside their range of validity when used in very specific applications. The FIT (Functionality Isolation Test) project is an international effort devoted to improve the confidence in the data produced by fuel cycle simulation tools. The scientific goal is to determine the optimum level of detail a fuel cycle simulator needs according to the type of study and the required confidence level. The project relies on a wide variety of fuel cycle simulators with a large range of complexity levels. The FIT project consists of isolating the impact of one targeted functionality on fuel cycle simulations. The impact of the functionality is assessed using a set of simple basic exercises specifically designed for this purpose, called ”functionality isolation.” The present work focuses on the impact on simulation results of using a fuel loading model (a relation that links the stock isotopic composition with the fresh fuel fabrication according to the reactor requirements) or a fixed fraction approach (the fresh fuel fissile fraction is fixed and does not depend on the stock isotopic composition). The paper first presents the FIT project. The exercise design is described and results show that using a fuel loading model approach has an important impact on fuel cycle outputs under certain conditions that are described. This result is reinforced by the fact that all fuel cycle simulators used in this exercise provide similar conclusions.},

	title = {Enabling {Load} {Following} {Capability} in the {Transatomic} {Power} {MSR}},
	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1877339},
	abstract = {This project is dedicated towards designing a fuel processing system that enables liquid-fueled molten salt reactors (MSR) to load follow by removing the dissolved xenon in the fuel salt. As one of the Gen-IV nuclear reactor concepts, the molten salt reactor receives increasing development interests in the recent years. One distinguishing feature of the liquid-fueled molten salt reactor is its improved ability to operate in a load-following mode by including the unique online fission product removal system. Load-following means that the reactor changes its power output based on the demand on the grid. Most of the current operating nuclear reactors have limited load-following ability and operate as the base load on the grid. Due to the rapid increase of solar energy, the requirement on load-following capacity is significantly increased because of the varying power output of the solar panels, yet the traditional load-following capacity is expected to decrease as the decarbonization of the grid continues. Therefore, the ability to perform load-following operation for the nuclear reactors will greatly enhance the resilience of the grid and make nuclear energy more economically competitive. This load-following feature is included in many commercial molten salt reactor designs, such as the designs by Transatomic Power, Terrestrial Energy, and Flibe Energy. Unfortunately, detailed analysis of the fuel processing system for commercial scale MSRs is still lacking, as well as how the fuel processing quantitively impacts the load-following operation. Moreover, experimental data for many of the underlying physics of fuel processing is limited. This project aims to pave the way for the fuel processing technology to advance to the commercial stage by performing combined experimental and simulation research. During the project period, four interconnected aspects of the development of the fuel processing system in liquid-fueled molten salt reactors are investigated. These aspects are the simulation and analysis of the fission product removal system, the fuel cycle simulation, the coupled reactor neutronics and thermal hydraulics transient simulation, and the gaseous fission product removal experiment. Multiphase CFD simulations are performed for components of the processing systems, and simplified air-water experiments are carried out to provide validation data. It is concluded that the CFD simulation can satisfactorily predict the system level performance of the components, and engineering models are constructed based on this success. Fuel cycle analysis is performed for two representative MSR design, the MSBR and the Transatomic Power MSR. Open-source code SaltProc is developed to incorporate the unique fuel processing system of the MSRs. It is concluded that the removal of xenon is essential for load-following operation in thermal spectrum MSR and Molten Salt Breeder Reactor. For the Transatomic Power MSR, the xenon poisoning effect is negligible due to its relatively fast neutron spectrum, though the overall fuel cycle economics still benefits from the removal of xenon. Coupled reactor neutronics and thermal hydraulics transient simulation is performed specifically for the Transatomic Power MSR. It is concluded that the reactor core design could perform power ramping fast enough to satisfy load-following operation. Combining the findings from each aspect, it is concluded that the load-following operation of a thermal neutron MSR is dependent upon the removal of xenon, which could be achieved for a commercial sized reactor using continuous inert gas sparging in a separate system with reasonable dimensions.},

This report quantitatively explores how these closures would undermine economic and decarbonization goals in the state of Illinois, such as an aggressive target to achieve a zero carbon electric grid by 2030.
Previous energy systems research has shown that such clean energy goals cannot be reached if nuclear plants prematurely retire [2, 3, 4]. In particular, the February 2021 National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine consensus report, “Accelerating Decarbonization of the U.S. Energy System,” determined unequivocally that US decarbonization will require keeping existing nuclear plants open [2]. Consistent with that liter- ature, our simulations indicate that decarbonization in Illinois will require not only maintenance but expansion of nuclear energy capacity.},

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic Power (TAP) MSR. A Python toolkit, SaltProc v0.1 [1–3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). More recently, an advanced SaltProc version (SaltProc v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the TAP system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards milestone M2.1: Demonstrate SaltProc and the steps toward the subsequent Task 2 objectives.},

Parameters compared include multiplication factor, reactivity coefficients, flux distribution, neutron spectrum and isotopic composition change with burnup. Seven organizations from four countries are taking part in this blind-benchmark exercise, using Monte Carlo and deterministic methods. Given the complex combination of materials and geometry, the FHR benchmark is expected to be challenging, particularly for deterministic codes. As the nuclear data libraries underpinning both deterministic and Monte Carlo methods have had limited testing for FHR systems, and molten salt systems in general, the benchmark aims to provide feedback to both the nuclear data community as well as molten salt reactor designers with regards to the variance of results with different nuclear data sources. This paper reports on the current results submitted and provides comparisons and analysis. Overall, the observed agreement is satisfactory, although notable differences are identified in specific cases, suggesting need for further in-depth analysis of those cases.},

	abstract = {Current nuclear reactors employed in the United States use Low Enriched Uranium (LEU)fuel enriched to no more than 5\%.  New reactor designs, such as the Ultra Safe Nuclear Cor-poration (USNC) Micro Modular Reactor (MMR)TM, will require High Assay Low EnrichedUranium (HALEU) fuel enriched between 5-20\%.  To meet HALEU fuel requirements, theU.S. Department of Energy is considering recovery and downblending of High Enriched Ura-nium (HEU) fuel and enriching natural uranium to the required levels [1], with each of thesemethods containing their own limitations.  Recovery and downblending of HEU fuel is lim-ited by the existing physical supply of HEU as well as downblending capacity.  Enrichment ofnatural uranium is limited by centrifuge capacity, in terms of Separative Work Unit (SWU).This work aims to quantify the resource requirements of the current U.S. reactor fleetand of the transition to different reactors that require HALEU fuel.  Fuel cycle simulationsare completed usingCyclus, an agent-based fuel cycle simulator [2].  Transition scenariosconsidered include use of the USNC MMRTMand the X-energy Xe-100TMreactor, which bothrequire HALEU fuel.  Resource requirements of interest include enriched fuel requirementsat each enrichment level, HEU required to meet HALEU demand, and natural uranium andSWU required to meet HALEU demand. These metrics will inform the material requirementsand  provide  insight  into  the  best  method  to  meet  fuel  requirements  for  these  transitionscenarios},

The current work introduces a reliable safety system based on control rods in addition to the online feed system reactivity control in the Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor (SD-TMSR). Three different initial fissile loadings are considered: 233U, reactor-grade Pu, and transuranic (TRU) elements as a startup fuel. We applied six different absorbing materials to investigate the main operational and safety parameters in the SD-TMSR: natural B4C, enriched B4C with 90\% 10B, HfB2, HfH1.62, Eu2O3, and Gd2O3. The present work focuses on control rod design, integral and differential control rod worth, shutdown margin, and shadowing effects at steady-state. We employed the SERPENT-2 Monte-Carlo code to calculate the reactivity worth and analyze the performance of the reactivity control system. We showed that 233U and reactor-grade Pu startup cores maintain adequate shutdown margin with all considered absorbers. Finally, this paper proposes a design of control rod clusters that compensate the excess reactivity of the SD-TMSR loaded with different initial fissile material.},

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) performed a study in August 2019 to analyze the
neutronics behavior of the Transatomic Power Molten Salt Reactor (TAP MSR) core during
loadfollowing operations, culminating in the Milestone 3.1 Report [1] . As a follow-up to the previous
work, we will be analyzing the thermal-hydraulics behavior of the TAP MSR in this work.},

	abstract = {In many fuel cycle simulators, the user must define a deployment scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid supply chain gaps. To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand-responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. Thus, a next-generation NFC simulator should predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined power demand. CYCLUS is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework [4]. In CYCLUS, each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the fuel cycle is an agent. Region agents represent geographical or political areas that institution and facility agents can be grouped into. Institution agents control the deployment and decommission of facility agents and represents legal operating organizations such as a utility, government, etc. Facility agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities. CYCAMORE provides agents to represent process physics of various components in the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment facility, reactor). The Demand-Driven CYCAMORE Archetypes project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop CYCLUS’ demand-driven deployment capabilities. This capability is added as a CYCLUS Institution agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. This demand-driven deployment capability is called d3ploy. In this paper, we explain the capabilities of d3ploy and demonstrate how d3ploy minimizes undersupply of all commodities in a few simulations while meeting key simulation constraints. Constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal power demand transition scenarios are demonstrated. Insights are discussed to inform parameter input decisions for future work in setting up larger transition scenarios that include many facilities. And finally, the more complex transition scenarios are demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Many nuclear power plants are at risk of shutting down due to a combination of policy decisions and financial strain [1]. Accurately predicting the generation from solar and wind may help minimize profit losses for nuclear power plants. Nu- clear power competes with natural gas to fulfill the net demand after accounting for renewable energy sources. Load following gives natural gas an economic edge over nuclear power be- cause natural gas plants can follow grid demand and even shut off when renewable penetration makes the price of electricity go negative [2]. It is possible for existing nuclear plants to load follow somewhat and some French nuclear plants have been retrofitted to follow daily variations in electricity demand [3]. As penetration of solar and wind energy increases around the world, load following will depend less on electric demand pro- files and more on renewable energy profiles. This shift makes load following with current nuclear power plants intractable [4]. Renewable energy challenges the base load electricity production that nuclear provides in the United States by in- troducing grid demand variability. Advanced reactor designs, like some Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), promise strong load following capabilities due to active 135Xe removal [5]. Unfor- tunately, the most mature MSR designs are at least a decade away from obtaining a commercial license in the United States. The climate crisis is too urgent to wait this long for nuclear power to become fully competitive with natural gas [6].
Variability has been the primary drawback for renewable energy sources like wind turbines, solar PV, and solar concen- trators, since their inception. This flaw worsens as renewable energy penetration increases [4]. Forecasting electricity pro- duction from renewable sources is therefore important for successful management of power systems [7]. Recent studies applied artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically multi- layer perceptrons, to the task of net load forecasting [7, 8, 9]. These studies made short term forecasts of 4-6 hours but nu- clear plants need accurate forecasts further ahead to facilitate load following. This study will be the first to apply Echo State Networks (ESNs) to the task of net load prediction.},

	abstract = {This article describes the motivation, design, and progress of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a digital object identifier (DOI), deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review. JOSS is a sponsored project of the nonprofit organization NumFOCUS and is an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative (OSI).},

	abstract = {Moltres is a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fueled molten salt reactors
(MSRs) (Lindsay et al. 2018). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and precursor
transport equations are set-up using an action system that allows the user to use an arbitrary
number of neutron energy and precursor groups respectively with minimal input
changes. Moltres sits on top of the Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(Gaston et al. 2015) and hence uses the finite element method to discretize the
governing partial differential equations. In general the resulting system of non-linear algebraic
equations is linearized using the Newton-Raphson method and then solved using
the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (Balay et al. 2017). Assembly
of the Jacobian and residual, and the linear solve are parallelized using MPI which
allows Moltres to be run in massively parallel environments. Runs on the Blue Waters
supercomputer at Illinois have utilized up to 608 cores.
Moltres and MOOSE allow use of different basis functions for different system variables.
Because of the purely diffusive nature of the neutron diffusion equations, neutron fluxes are
typically discretized using continuous first-degree Lagrange polynomials and the degrees of
freedom are associated with mesh nodes. The temperature variable may also be discretized
with a continuous Lagrange basis, or a discontinuous basis of arbitrary degree monomials
may be employed depending on the relative balance of heat convection to conduction. The
purely hyperbolic precursor transport is currently discretized using constant monomials,
which is equivalent to a first-order finite volume discretization. Moltres supports both
segregated (through Picard iteration) and monolithic solutions of the equation system.
However, due to the feedback between the power spectrum and temperature dependence
of macroscopic cross-sections, monolithic solves have demonstrated superior robustness
with segregated techniques often unable to converge to a solution. This result emphasizes
the importance of a fully coupled multi-physics framework like the one that Moltres and
MOOSE provide and suggests that iteratively coupling codes devoted to single physics
(Kópházi, Lathouwers, and Kloosterman 2009) may result in limited flexibility.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

These SFRs are fuelled with UNF accumulated by other EU nations and reprocessed in France. The impact of reactor lifetime extensions and SFR breeding ratios on time-to-transition were investigated with additional simulations. These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment of additional LWRs by accepting UNF from other EU nations, that lifetime extensions delay time-to-transition, and improved breeding ratios are not particularly impactful.},

Costs drive the equation, but policies affecting electricity pricing also influence nuclear power revenues at a fundamental level. In current reactors and their associated fuel cycles, capital, operation, and maintenance costs increasingly dominate the economics of nuclear power.
Advanced reactor designs and fuel cycle choices can impact these costs both positively
and negatively. While fuel cycle advancements also impact fuel costs, this component has a relatively small impact on the overall cost of nuclear electricity production, particularly in comparison to capital costs. If advanced reactors can offer very high-temperature heat appropriate for industrial processing, natively couple with storage technologies, or can otherwise acheive load following behavior, then they may become more financially feasible than the current fleet.},

	abstract = {Coupled reactor kinetics and heat transfer models have been developed at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) to study Pebble-Bed, Fluoride-salt-cooled, High-temperature Reactors (PB-FHRs) transient behaviors. This paper discusses a coupled point kinetics model and a two-dimensional diffusion model. The former is based on the point kinetics equations with six groups of delayed neutrons and the lumped capacitance heat transfer equations. To account for the reflector effect on neutron lifetime, additional (fictional) groups of delayed neutrons are added in the point kinetics equations to represent the thermalized neutrons coming back from the reflectors. The latter is based on coupled multi-group neutron diffusion and finite element heat transfer model. Multi-group cross sections and diffusion coefficients are generated using the Monte Carlo code Serpent and defined as input in COMSOL 5.0.},

	abstract = {This work evaluates a potential solution for two pressing
matters in the viability of nuclear energy: spent fuel disposal
and power plants that no longer operate. The potential benefits
of siting a borehole repository at a shut down nuclear power
plant facility are analyzed from the perspective of myriad stake-
holders. This assessment indicates that integrated siting will
make economic use of the shut down power plant, take advan-
tage of spent fuel handling infrastructure at those sites, mini-
mize transportation costs, expedite emptying the crowded spent
fuel storage pools accross the country, and will do so at sites
more likely to have consenting communities.},

The results here provide an overview of the relative importance of processes and parameters that affect the long term performance attributes of clay generic disposal environments. This work is not intended to give an assessment of the performance of a specific disposal system. Rather, it is intended to generically identify properties and parameters expected to influence repository performance in generic clay geologic environments.},

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle is an established field with multiple players. Prior development work has utilized tech- niques such as system dynamics to provide a solution structure for the matching of supply and demand in these simulations. In general, however, simulation infrastructure development has occured in relatively closed circles, each effort having unique considerations as to the cases which are desired to be modeled. Accordingly, individual simulators tend to have their design decisions driven by specific use cases. Presented in this work is a proposed supply and demand matching algorithm that lever- ages the techniques of the well-studied field of mathematical programming. A generic approach is achieved by treating fa- cilities as individual entities and actors in the supply-demand market which denote preferences amongst commodities. Using such a framework allows for varying levels of interaction fi- delity, ranging from low-fidelity, quick solutions to high-fidelity solutions that model individual transactions (e.g. at the fuel- assembly level). The power of the technique is that it allows such flexibility while still treating the problem in a generic man- ner, encapsulating simulation engine design decisions in such a way that future simulation requirements can be relatively easily added when needed.},

	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {The University of California, Berkeley (UCB), has developed a preconceptual design for a commercial pebble-bed (PB), fluoride salt–cooled, high-temperature reactor (FHR) (PB-FHR). The baseline design for this Mark-I PB-FHR (Mk1) plant is a 236-MW(thermal) reactor. The Mk1 uses a fluoride salt coolant with solid, coated-particle pebble fuel. The Mk1 design differs from earlier FHR designs because it uses a nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle designed to produce 100 MW(electric) of base-load electricity using a modified General Electric 7FB gas turbine. For peak electricity generation, the Mk1 has the ability to boost power output up to 242 MW(electric) using natural gas co-firing. The Mk1 uses direct heating of the power conversion fluid (air) with the primary coolant salt rather than using an intermediate coolant loop. By combining results from computational neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and pebble dynamics, UCB has developed a detailed design of the annular core and other key functional features. Both an active normal shutdown cooling system and a passive, natural-circulation-driven emergency decay heat removal system are included. Computational models of the FHR-validated using experimental data from the literature and from scaled thermal-hydraulic facilities-have led to a set of design criteria and system requirements for the Mk1 to operate safely and reliably. Three-dimensional, computer-aided-design models derived from the Mk1 design criteria are presented.},

Such quantification can aid timely detection of material diversion. This paper describes the facility archetype design, pyroprocessing flowsheets captured by the model, and simulation capabilities it enables. To analyze data retrieved from the model, we additionally propose a class for tracking and observing signatures and observables which will be extensible for other facility archetypes in the future.},

The primary purpose of JOSS is to enable developers of research software to receive citation credit equivalent to typical archival publications. JOSS papers are deliberately extremely short, and are required to include a short abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, authors and their affiliations, and key references, as well as link to an archived version of the software (e.g., DOI obtained from Zenodo). Upon acceptance, papers receive a CrossRef DOI. Rather than a review of a lengthy software paper (including, e.g., methodology, validation, sample results), JOSS submissions undergo rigorous peer review of both the abstract and software itself, including documentation, tests, continuous integration, and licensing. The JOSS review process is modeled on the established approach of the rOpenSci collaboration. The entire submission and review process occurs openly on GitHub; papers not yet accepted remain visible and under review until the authors make appropriate changes for acceptance---unlike other journals, papers requiring major revision are not rejected. Since its public release in May 2016, JOSS has published 26 accepted papers as of September 2016, with an additional 20 submitted and under review.},

@inproceedings{huff_current_2017,
	address = {Seoul, South Korea},
	title = {Current {Status} of {Predictive} {Transition} {Capability} in {Fuel} {Cycle} {Simulation}},
	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle simulation scenarios are most naturally described as 
constrained objective functions. The objectives are often systemic 
demands such as ``achieve 1\% growth for total electricity production 
and reach 10\% uranium utilization''. The constraints take 
the form of nuclear fuel cycle technology availability 
(``reprocessing begins after 2025 and fast reactors first become 
available in 2050'').

To match the natural constrained objective form of the scenario 
definition, NFC simulators must bring demand responsive 
deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic.

In particular, a NFC simulator should have the 
capability to deploy supporting fuel cycle facilities to enable 
a demand to be met. Take, for instance, the standard once through fuel 
cycle. Reactors may be deployed to meet a objective power demand. 
However, new mines, mills, and enrichment facilities will also need to be 
deployed to ensure that reactors have sufficient fuel to produce power.  
In many simulators, the unrealistic solution to this problem is to 
simply have infinite capacity support facilities. Alternatively, 
detailing the deployment timeline of all facilities becomes the 
responsibility of the user.

The authors seek to identify the most flexible, general, and performant 
algorithms applicable to this modeling challenge.  Accordingly, a review was 
conducted of current NFC simulation tools to determine the 
current capabilites for demand-driven and transition scenarios. 
Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic
innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains
such as economics and industrial engineering.},

For robustness, this package employs various tools within the scientific python ecosystem. For additional ease of use, it employs a reactor-agnostic, object-oriented data model, allowing nuclear engineers to rapidly prototype nuclear reactor control and safety systems in the context of their novel nuclear reactor designs.},

	title = {Investigation of {Agricultural} {Uses} of {Nuclear} {Waste} {Heat}. {UIUC} {Technical} {Report}. {October}, 2018.},
	abstract = {Nuclear power plants (NPPs) produce significant quantities of waste heat due to the low thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle. This waste heat carries roughly two-thirds of the total power generated at a nuclear power plant. It is responsibly released to the environment as a warm water flow, carrying with it a massive amount of low-grade thermal energy. As of now, this energy is lost from all Exelon NPPs. This waste heat is essentially a free source of energy and utilization projects offer the potential to significantly increase the thermal efficiency and profitability of centralized power generating stations, in particular NPPs.
Agricultural projects, particularly climate-controlled greenhouses, may show the most dramatic benefit from waste-heat utilization. Due to the relatively low temperature requirements of greenhouses, heating costs may be eliminated or cut substantially by the implementation of waste heat. The technical readiness of coupling central power generation station’s waste heat discharge to climate-controlled greenhouses is high and has been demonstrated. Implementing this combined heat and power approach to Exelon’s fleet of NPPs could offer significant advantages over fossil fueled power plants due to their high capacity factor, and strictly controlled and monitored water discharge.   
Exelon NPPs at Braidwood, Byron, Dresden, and Calvert Cliffs hold potential to supply significant agricultural waste heat. Few regulations exist specific to the use of waste heat from NPPs, but the discharge of waste heat from NPPs is strictly regulated, mitigating potential for regulatory hurdles to its use in other industries. Waste heat from Exelon’s NPPs is an untapped and potentially lucrative commodity. In the Midwest, the location of Exelon’s NPPs offers interesting opportunities for waste heat use in agriculture. The cold Midwest climate is normally a limiting factor in crop diversity and heated greenhouses are an option for overcoming this issue, but the heating costs are a barrier themselves. With cooperation between growers and the Exelon Corporation, waste heat may be commoditized while also facilitating more efficient and diverse growing operations. Waste heat use is not limited to farming operations. There are a host of industries that can benefit from waste heat use that may be local to other power plants. The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is located ideally to facilitate the farming of oysters with waste heat or even provide heat for liquefied natural gas vaporization. 
This report details a preliminary analysis to evaluate the potential for utilizing waste heat from NPPs. From the exhaustive review of past waste heat efforts, agricultural options, and primary economic and radiological factors, the technical readiness is shown to be high and the concept is sound. It is recommended that a detailed analysis should follow that includes: coupling candidate NPPs to specific greenhouse architectures, exploration of high-value crop options in prototypic and bounding event environments, and a detailed economic assessment.},

The primary purpose of JOSS is to enable developers of research software to receive citation credit equivalent to typical archival publications. Rather than a review of a lengthy software paper (including, e.g., methodology, validation, sample results), JOSS submissions undergo rigorous peer review of both the abstract and software itself, including documentation, tests, continuous integration, and licensing. The JOSS review process is modeled on the established approach of the rOpenSci collaboration. The entire submission and review process occurs openly on GitHub; articles not yet accepted remain visible and under review until the authors make appropriate changes for acceptance—unlike other journals, articles requiring major revision are not rejected. JOSS published 111 articles in its first year (May 2016–2016), with {\textgreater}50 articles under review.},

	abstract = {The theory of non-ideal gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, for instance the van der Waals gas model, has played a central role in the understanding of coexisting phases. Here, we report a combined experimental, numerical and theoretical study of a liquid-solid-like phase transition which takes place in a vertically vibrated fluidized granular monolayer. The first experimental setup is a long, narrow channel, with a width of the order of a few particle diameters, hence the dynamics is quasi-one-dimensional. We have considered this configuration to characterize the dynamic behavior of the phase transition. The second setup is used to measure the pressure as function of particle density in order to clarify the physical mechanism behind this phase transition. We demonstrate that the transition is mediated by waves and that it is triggered by a negative compressibility as in van der Waals phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. Finally, in order to further characterize this phase transition, we study static and dynamic correlation functions, and bond-orientational order parameters.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste disposal decisions are technologically coupled. However, current nuclear fuel cycle simulators lack dynamic repository performance analysis due to the computational burden of high-fidelity hydrolgic contaminant transport models. The Cyder disposal environment and repository module was developed to fill this gap. It implements medium-fidelity hydrologic radionuclide transport models to support assessment appropriate for fuel cycle simulation in the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. Rapid modeling of hundreds of discrete waste packages in a geologic environment is enabled within this module by a suite of four closed form models for advective, dispersive, coupled, and idealized contaminant transport: a Degradation Rate model, a Mixed Cell model, a Lumped Parameter model, and a 1-D Permeable Porous Medium model. A summary of the Cyder module, its timestepping algorithm, and the mathematical models implemented within it are presented. Additionally, parametric demonstrations simulations performed with Cyder are presented and shown to demonstrate functional agreement with parametric simulations conducted in a standalone hydrologic transport model, the Clay Generic Disposal System Model developed by the Used Fuel Disposition Campaign Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy.},

Given the abundance of WH from NPPs and the ubiquity of generally low-grade heat requirements of agricultural operations, from production to post-harvest, there is remarkable potential to harness NPP WH for agricultural uses with mutual economic advantages to NPPs and agricultural sectors. Taking advantage of this WH resource may improve the financial outlook of both the partnered power plants and agricultural businesses by providing an additional revenue stream, decreased heating costs, and a reduced carbon footprint. This review summarizes and interprets the historical discourse and research on agricultural applications of NPP WH in the U.S., and synthesizes technical constraints, unknowns, and opportunities for realizing the benefits of WH derived from the nuclear energy sector for agricultural value chains. Previous applications of WH in the agricultural industry demonstrate that this is a viable option to the benefit of the parties involved under the right conditions, but relatively little has been done to further this technology in the U.S. in recent years or explore novel applications. A revival of interest in this technology may be warranted given the current outlook for NPPs in the U.S. and a general interest in reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.},

	abstract = {This research qualitatively reviews literature regarding energy system modeling in Japan specific to the future hydrogen economy, leveraging quantitative model outcomes to establish the potential future deployment of hydrogen in Japan. The analysis focuses on the four key sectors of storage, supplementing the gas grid, power generation, and transportation, detailing the potential range of hydrogen technologies which are expected to penetrate Japanese energy markets up to 2050 and beyond. Alongside key model outcomes, the appropriate policy settings, governance and market mechanisms are described which underpin the potential hydrogen economy future for Japan. We find that transportation, gas grid supplementation, and storage end-uses may emerge in significant quantities due to policies which encourage ambitious implementation targets, investment in technologies and research and development, and the emergence of a future carbon pricing regime. On the other hand, for Japan which will initially be dependent on imported hydrogen, the cost of imports appears critical to the emergence of broad hydrogen usage, particularly in the power generation sector. Further, the consideration of demographics in Japan, recognizing the aging, shrinking population and peoples\&rsquo; energy use preferences will likely be instrumental in realizing a smooth transition toward a hydrogen economy.},

	abstract = {The present U.S. nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options that make nuclear energy technology more desirable. Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This work introduces and demonstrates the demand-driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework. User-controlled capabilities such as time-series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. The demand-driven deployment capabilities are referred to as d3ploy. We demonstrate the capability of d3ploy to predict future commodities’ supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. Using d3ploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user simulation setup time compared to previous efforts that required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle facilities.},

This quick, flexible, medium-fidelity method to estimate depleted PWR fuel assembly compositions is used to model scenarios in which the PWR fuel burnup and enrichment vary over time. The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST\&DARDS) Unified Database (UDB) provided a ground truth on which the model trained. We validated the model by comparing the U.S. UNF inventory profile predicted by the model with the UDB UNF inventory profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error for UNF inventory decay heat and activity and less than 2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model takes 0.27 s for 100 predictions, compared to 118 s for 100 Oak Ridge Isotope GENeration (ORIGEN) calculations. We also implemented this model into Cyclus, an agent-based Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity PWR depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of batches with assemblies of varying burnup. Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model, this trained model can provide open-source depletion capabilities to NFC simulators. We show that training an artificial neural network with a dataset from a complex fuel depletion model can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.},

	abstract = {The SD-TMSR (2,250 MWth) is a Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor. The active core of the SD-TMSR is divided into the inner zone (486 fuel tubes) and the outer zone (522 fuel tubes) to improve the Th-U3 breeding performance. This work adopted the SERPENT-2 Monte Carlo code to analyze the whole core model of the SD-TMSR. Built-in SERPENT-2 capabilities simulated online reprocessing and refueling and calculated the multiplication factor and Breeding Ratio (BR). We found that the molten salt Temperature Coefficient of Reactivity (αT) was negative for initial and equilibrium states. This study investigated the variation of the multiplication factor, BR, and build-up of important nuclides in the core as a function of burnup. Under online reprocessing and refueling, we studied the variation of the reactivity during 60 years of reactor operation. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation was calculated. Finally, these simulations determined the appropriate 232Th and 233U feed rates for maintaining criticality and enabled analysis of the overall SD-TMSR fuel cycle performance.},

	abstract = {Liquid-fueled Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) systems represent advances in safety, economics, and sustainability. The MSR has been designed to operate with a Th/233U fuel cycle with 233U used as startup fissile material. Since 233U does not exist in nature, we must examine other available fissile materials to start up these reactor concepts. This work investigates the fuel cycle and neutronics performance of the Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor (SD-TMSR) with different fissile material loadings at startup: High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) (19.79\%), Pu mixed with HALEU (19.79\%), reactor-grade Pu (a mixture of Pu isotopes chemically extracted from Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) spent nuclear fuel (SNF) with 33 GWd/tHM burnup), transuranic elements (TRU) from Light Water Reactor (LWR) SNF, and 233U. The MSR burnup routine provided by SERPENT-2 is used to simulate the online reprocessing and refueling in the SD-TMSR. The effective multiplication factor, fuel salt composition evolution, and net production of 233U are studied in the present work. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation is calculated. The results show that the continuous flow of reactor-grade Pu helps transition to the thorium fuel cycle within a relatively short time (≈4.5 years) compared to 26 years for 233U startup fuel. Finally, using TRU as the initial fuel materials offers the possibility of operating the SD-TMSR for an extended period of time (≈40 years) without any external feed of 233U.},

	abstract = {The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) has garnered much interest for its inherent safety and sustainbility features. The MSFR can adopt a closed thorium fuel cycle for sustainable operation through the breeding of 233 U from 232 Th. The fuel composition changes significantly over the course of its lifespan. In this study, we investigated the steady state and transient behavior of the MSFR using Moltres, a coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code developed within the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework. Three different fuel compositions, start-up, early-life, and equilibrium, were examined for potentially dangerous core temperature excursions during a unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS) accident. The six-group and total neutron flux distributions showed good agreement with SERPENT and published MSFR results, while the temperature distribution and total power showed discrepancies which can be attributed toknown sources of error. For the transient behavior under the ULOHS scenario, while the transition time towards the new steady state core temperature is also in good agreement with existing MSFR simulations by Fiorina et al., Moltres under-estimated the temperature rise by a factor of ten, due to the same sources of error affecting the steady state results. While an MSFR loaded with start-up fuel composition operates at a higher temperature than with the other two fuel compositions, all three cases were shown to be inherently safe due to thestrong negative temperature feedback.},

These systems are often referred to as nuclear hy- brid energy systems (NHES) and are generally robust, reliable, economically appealing, and have low to zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1, 2, 3, 4]. In 2015, the University of Illi- nois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) made a commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 in the Illinois Climate Ac- tion Plan (iCAP) [5]. This plan identified nuclear energy as a potential contributor to this goal. In this work we use the RAVEN framework to find the optimal size for a micro-reactor that would minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the UIUC embedded grid. The greatest source economic variability is contained in the capital costs of a micro-reactor. Thus we examine both scenarios where the reactor is provided at no cost to the university and purchased at full price.},

	abstract = {Depletion simulations of flowing fuel molten salt reactors commonly do not distinguish between in-core and ex-core regions.
Instead, they either irradiate the entire primary loop while scaling the flux, or irradiate the in-core volume alone, which leaves some amount of fuel salt out of the simulation.
Either approximation results in some level of inaccuracy in nuclide concentrations.
Various methods account for the flow of fuel salt between spatial regions, but a major hurdle is the computational cost.
This work investigates a spatially resolved method to account for the impact flow and chemical removal has on concentrations of nuclides rapidly and accurately.
Comparisons are made in this work between a spatially resolved method, spatially unresolved scaled flux method, other work from the literature, and experimental data.
These comparisons show that the scaled flux method is sufficient for modeling most nuclides unless there is a large spatially dependent loss term, such as a large ex-core removal rate.
In such a case, a spatially resolved method is needed.},

	abstract = {On 25-26 March 2023, the U.S. National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) held its 2024 annual meeting in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. The NCRP dates from 1929, and this meeting celebrated the 60th anniversary of receiving a U.S. Congressional Charter. For this annual meeting the NCRP felt it was essential to provide a briefing about advanced and small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). The Journal of Radiological Protection is delighted to publish the following synopsis of material presented at the U.S. NCRP meeting. This synopsis is divided into five sections. The first section provides an overview of the whole meeting together with summaries of two context setting overview papers. The following four sessions of this synopsis are specific to advanced and small modular nuclear power reactors. The meeting also included keynote presentations by three of NCRP annual award recipients. The meeting topical areas were Technology Overview and Critical Issues. The individual papers laid the groundwork to understanding reactor technologies, terminology, and the fundamental concepts and processes for electrical generation. The perspectives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and states, through the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors were provided. The papers included a discussion of diverse topics including potential emergency preparedness considerations, radiological survey requirements, an evaluation of the future of nuclear power, the economics of reactors (both large and small), and the critical issues identified by the recent National Academies of Sciences' study on advanced reactors. The summary papers were developed to briefly document the major points and concepts presented during the oral papers presented at the 2024 NCRP Annual Meeting. The meeting heralded the dawn of a new era for commercial nuclear power.},

	abstract = {A versatile, parallelizable Python 2.7 library was developed in order to simulate once-through molten salt reactor depletion in a realistic manner via the coupled neutronics/depletion code Serpent 2. Realistic in this sense entails two aspects: reactivity of the core, and oxidation potential of the fuel. The core reactivity should be maintained near zero as with any nuclear reactor. Gross reactivity control is provided by variations of the refuel rate of the reactor. Fine reactivity adjustments are expected to be done with control mechanisms in real-life power operation. The Python library developed allows a user to set bounds on the desired ke f f value. Fuel oxidation potential must be controlled for any liquid fueled reactor. As a simple example, consider this fission where the fuel becomes more oxidizing: UF\_4 → SrF\_2 + Xe + 2F{\textasciicircum}- It can be shown using expected fission product oxidation state data that for these reactors, the fuel will become more oxidizing over time as a result of accumulation of excess fluoride ion. Addition of a reducing agent to reactor fuel will be necessary in the operation of molten salt reactors.},

	abstract = {Delayed neutron precursor (DNP) group data are important for modeling reactor dynamics. Although the data for individual DNPs have been developed over time, the DNP group data present in the Evaluated Nuclear Data Files (ENDF) have not been updated in the past 20 years. In this work, we use SCALE to recreate the Godiva experiment that was used to generate the original DNP group structure for fast fission of 235U. However, each DNP is modeled using up-to-date data, and the results are then converted into a newly updated group structure. This conversion uses an iterative linear least squares solver to minimize chi-squared. The approaches used in this work also enable energy spectrum generation and uncertainty tracking. The method used in this paper for fast 235U fission DNP group structure updating can be applied to different energies and fissile nuclides. Demonstration of the uncertainty tracking in reactor kinetics and dynamics simulations is shown using point reactor kinetics simulations. Results show that there are data discrepancies between the International Atomic Energy Agency database and data used in ORIGEN, which are currently being fixed. Results also show that the proposed method for group spectra generation performs well.},
